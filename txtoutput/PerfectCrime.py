PERFECTCRIME = ['Were it not for appearances, the world would be a perfect crime, that is, a crime without a criminal, without a victim and without a motive.', 'And the truth would forever have withdrawn from it and its secret would never be revealed, for want of any clues [traces] being left behind.', 'But the fact is that the crime is never perfect, for the world betrays itself by appearances, which are the clues to its non-existence, the traces of the continuity of the nothing.', 'For the nothing itself -- the continuity of the nothing -- leaves traces.', 'And that is the way the world betrays its secret.', 'That is the way it allows itself to be sensed, while at the same time hiding away behind appearances.', 'The artist, too, is always close to committing the perfect crime: saying nothing.', 'But he turns away from it, and his work is the trace of that criminal imperfection.', "The artist is, in Michaux's words, the one who, with all his might, resists the fundamental drive not to leave traces.", 'The perfection of the crime lies in the fact that it has always-already been accomplished -- perfectum.', 'A misappropriation of the world as it is, before it even shows itself.', 'It will never, therefore, be discovered.', 'There will be no Last Judgement to punish or pardon it.', 'There will be no end, because things have always-already happened.', 'Neither resolution nor absolution, but inevitable unfolding of the consequences.', 'Precession of the original crime -- which we might perhaps be said to find in derisory form in the current precession of simulacra.', 'After that, our destiny is the accomplishment of this crime, its inexorable unfolding, the continuity of the evil, the continuation of the nothing.', 'We shall never experience the primal scene, but at every moment we experience its prolongation and its expiation.', 'There is no end to this and the consequences are incalculable.', 'Just as we cannot plumb the first few seconds of the Big Bang, so we cannot locate those few seconds in which the original crime took place either.', "It is a fossilized crime, then, like the `fossilized' background noise scattered about the universe.", 'And it is the energy of that crime, like that of the initial explosion, which will spread through the world until, perhaps, it exhausts itself.', 'This is the mythic vision of the original crime, the vision of the alter-ation of the world in the play of seduction and appearances, and of its definitive illusoriness.', 'This is the form the mystery takes.', "The great philosophical question used to be `Why is there something rather than nothing?'", "Today, the real question is: `Why is there nothing rather than something?'", 'The absence of things from themselves, the fact that they do not take place though they appear to do so, the fact that everything withdraws behind its own appearance and is, therefore, never identical with itself, is the material illusion of the world.', 'And, deep down, this remains the great riddle, the enigma which fills us with dread and from which we protect ourselves with the formal illusion of truth.', 'On pain of dread, we have to decipher the world and therefore wipe out the initial illusoriness of the world.', 'We can bear neither the void, nor the secret, nor pure appearance.', 'And why should we decipher it instead of letting its illusion shine out as such, in all its glory?', 'Well, the fact that we cannot bear its enigmatic character is also an enigma, also part of the enigma.', 'It is part of the world that we cannot bear either the illusion of the world or pure appearance.', 'We would be no better at coping with radical truth and transparency, if these existed.', 'Truth wants to give herself naked.', 'She is desperately seeking nudity, like Madonna in the film which brought her fame.', "That hopeless striptease is the very striptease of reality, which `disrobes' in the literal sense, offering up to the eyes of gullible voyeurs the appearance of nudity.", 'But the fact is that this nudity wraps it in a second skin, which no longer has even the erotic charm of the dress.', "There is no longer any need even of bachelors to strip her bare, since she has herself given up trompe-l'oeil for striptease.", 'And, indeed, the main objection to reality is its propensity to submit unconditionally to every hypothesis you can make about it.', 'With this its most abject conformism, it discourages the liveliest minds.', 'You can subject it -- and its principle (what do they get up to together, by the way, apart from dully copulating and begetting reams of obviousness?)', '-- to the most cruel torments, the most obscene provocations, the most paradoxical insinuations.', 'It submits to everything with unrelenting servility.', 'Reality is a bitch.', "And that is hardly surprising, since it is the product of stupidity's fornication with the spirit of calculation -- the dregs of the sacred illusion offered up to the jackals of science.", 'To recover the trace of the nothing, of the incompleteness, the imperfection of the crime, we have, then, to take something away from the reality of the world.', 'To recover the constellation of the mystery [secret], we have to take something away from the accumulation of reality and language.', 'We have to take words from language one by one, take things from reality one by one, wrest the same away from the same.', 'Behind every fragment of reality, something has to have disappeared in order to ensure the continuity of the nothing -- without, however, yielding to the temptation of annihilation, for disappearance has to remain a living disappearance, and the trace of the crime a living trace.', 'What we have forgotten in modernity, by dint of constantly accumulating, adding, going for more, is that force comes from subtraction, power from absence.', 'Because we are no longer capable today of coping with the symbolic mastery of absence, we are immersed in the opposite illusion, the disenchanted illusion of the proliferation of screens and images.', 'Now, the image can no longer imagine the real, because it is the real.', 'It can no longer dream it, since it is its virtual reality.', 'It is as though things had swallowed their own mirrors and had become transparent to themselves, entirely present to themselves in a ruthless transcription, full in the light and in real time.', 'Instead of being absent from themselves in illusion, they are forced to register on thousands of screens, off whose horizons not only the real has disappeared, but the image too.', 'The reality has been driven out of reality.', 'Only technology perhaps still binds together the scattered fragments of the real.', 'But what has become of the constellation of meaning in all this?', 'The only suspense which remains is that of knowing how far the world can derealize itself before succumbing to its reality deficit or, conversely, how far it can hyperrealize itself before succumbing to an excess of reality (the point when, having become perfectly real, truer than true, it will fall into the clutches of total simulation).', 'Yet it is not certain that the constellation of the mystery is wiped out by the transparency of the virtual universe, nor that the power of illusion is swept away by the technical operation of the world.', 'Behind all technologies one can sense a kind of absolute affectation and double game, their very exorbitance turning them into a game by which the world shows through, from behind the illusion of its being transformed.', 'Is technology the lethal alternative to the illusion of the world, or is it merely a gigantic avatar of the same basic illusion, its subtle final twist, the last hypostasis?', 'Perhaps, through technology, the world is toying with us, the object is seducing us by giving us the illusion of power over it.', 'A dizzying hypothesis: rationality, culminating in technical virtuality, might be the last of the ruses of unreason, of that will to illusion of which, as Nietzsche says, the will to truth is merely a derivative and an avatar.', 'On the horizon of simulation, not only has the world disappeared but the very question of its existence can no longer be posed.', 'But this is perhaps a ruse of the world itself.', 'The iconolaters of Byzantium were subtle folk, who claimed to represent God to his greater glory but who, simulating God in images, thereby dissimulated the problem of his existence.', 'Behind each of these images, in fact, God had disappeared.', 'He was not dead; he had disappeared.', 'That is to say, the problem no longer even arose.', 'It was resolved by simulation.', 'This is what we do with the problem of the truth or reality of this world: we have resolved it by technical simulation, and by creating a profusion of images in which there is nothing to see.', 'But is it not the strategy of God himself to use images in order to disappear, himself obeying the urge to leave no trace?', 'So the prophecy has been fulfilled: we live in a world where the highest function of the sign is to make reality disappear and, at the same time, to mask that disappearance.', 'Art today does the same.', 'The media today do the same.', 'That is why they are doomed to the same fate.', 'Because nothing wants exactly to be looked at any longer, but merely to be visually absorbed and circulate without leaving a trace -- thus outlining, as it were, the simplified aesthetic form of impossible exchange -- it is difficult today to recover a grasp on appearances.', 'With the result that the discourse which would account for them would be a discourse in which there was nothing to say -- the equivalent of a world where there is nothing to see.', 'The equivalent of a pure object, of an object which is not an object.', 'The harmonious equivalence of nothing to nothing, of Evil to Evil.', 'But the object which is not an object continues to obsess you by its empty, immaterial presence.', 'The whole problem is: on the outer fringes of the nothing, to materialize that nothing; on the outer fringes of the void, to trace out the mark of the void; on the outer fringes of indifference, to play by the mysterious rules of indifference.', 'There is no point identifying the world.', 'Things have to be grasped in their sleep, or in any other circumstance where they are absent from themselves.', 'As in the House of the Sleeping Beauties, where the old men spend the night beside the women and, though mad with desire, do not touch them, and slip away before they wake.', 'They too are lying next to an object which is not an object, the total indifference of which heightens the erotic charge.', 'But the most enigmatic thing is that it is not possible to know whether the women are really asleep or whether they are not maliciously taking pleasure, from the depths of their sleep, in their seductiveness and their own suspended desire.', 'Not to be sensitive to this degree of unreality and play, this degree of malice and ironic wit on the part of language and the world is, in effect, to be incapable of living.', 'Intelligence is precisely this sensing of the universal illusion, even in amorous passion -- though without the natural course of that passion being impaired.', 'There is something stronger than passion: illusion.', 'There is something stronger than sex or happiness: the passion for illusion.', 'There is no point identifying the world.', 'We cannot even identify our own faces, since mirrors impair their symmetry.', 'To see our own face as it is would be madness, since we would no longer have any mystery for ourselves and would, therefore, be annihilated by transparency.', 'Might it not be said that man has evolved into a form such that his face remains invisible to him and he becomes definitively unidentifiable, not only in the mystery of his face, but in any of his desires?', 'But it is the same with any object which reaches us only in a definitively alter-ed state, even when it does so on the screen of science, in the mirrors of information or on the screens of our brains.', 'Thus, all things offer themselves up without a hope of being anything other than illusions of themselves.', 'And it is right that this should be so.', 'Fortunately, the objects which appear to us have always-already disappeared.', 'Fortunately, nothing appears to us in real time, any more than do the stars in the night sky.', 'If the speed of light were infinite, all the stars would be there simultaneously and the celestial vault would be an unbearable incandescence.', 'Fortunately, nothing takes place in real time.', 'Otherwise, we would be subjected, where information is concerned, to the light of all events, and the present would be an unbearable incandescence.', 'Fortunately, we live on the basis of a vital illusion, on the basis of an absence, an unreality, a non-immediacy of things.', 'Fortunately, nothing is instantaneous, simultaneous or contemporary.', 'Fortunately, nothing is present or identical to itself.', 'Fortunately, reality does not take place.', 'Fortunately, the crime is never perfect.', 'The radical illusion is that of the original crime, by which the world is alter-ed from the beginning, and is never identical to itself, never real.', 'The world exists only through this definitive illusion which is that of the play of appearances -- the very site of the unceasing disappearance of all meaning and all finality.', 'And this is not merely metaphysical: in the physical order, too, from its origin -- whatever that may be -- the world has been forever appearing and disappearing.', "An alter-ation which tends to diminish with increasing information and which will, in the end, be eliminated by absolute information: the world's equivalence to the world -- the final illusion, that of a world which is perfect, fully realized, fully effectuated, a world which is consummated and has attained the height of existence and reality, and also the furthermost extent of its possibilities.", 'It is God (this we cannot hide) who stands at the end of this process of increasing information and complexification, of verification of the world in real time.', 'It is God who presides over this dissolution of the world as illusion and its resurrection as simulacrum and virtual reality, at the end of a process of extenuation of all its possibilities by the real.', 'It is God who presides over the unconditional realization of the world and its final illusion.', 'God is never at the origin, but always at the end.', 'And so we can say that that end is necessarily an unhappy one, and it is as well to leave it hanging.', 'The fact that the world is illusion follows from its radical imperfection.', 'If everything had been perfect, the world would quite simply not exist and if, by some misfortune, it were to become so again, it would quite simply not exist any more.', 'This is the essence of crime: if it is perfect, it leaves no clue, no trace.', "So what guarantees the world's existence for us is its accidental, criminal, imperfect character.", 'And it follows from this that it can be given to us only as illusion.', 'All that is projected beyond this illusion, beyond this accidental manifestness of the world, which forever distances it from its meaning and origin, is merely a justificatory phantasy.', 'The projecting back of a phantom causality and intelligibility, of an exceptional order which merely confirms the rule of accidental disorder and is, doubtless, merely one episode in that disorder.', 'We oscillate between an illusion and a truth which are each equally unbearable.', 'But perhaps truth is even more unbearable, and we ultimately desire the illusion of the world, even if we take up all the arms of truth, science and metaphysics against it.', 'Our latent truth is that of nihilism, but, as Nietzsche writes, `truth cannot be regarded as the highest power.', "The will to semblance, to illusion, to deception, to becoming, to change (to objective deception) is to be regarded here as deeper, more original, more metaphysical than the will to truth, to reality, to being -- the latter is itself merely a form of the will to illusion.'", 'How can we believe in the truth of what has neither principle nor end?', 'All we can add to it is this little final illusion, together with the causal illusion of a non-accidental effect -- a reparative illusion when set against the devastating illusion of the world.', 'But this is merely an artificial supplement.', 'Our consciousness, by which we aspire to outdo the world, is merely a secondary excess, the phantom extremity of a world for which this simulation of consciousness is entirely superfluous.', 'We shall never achieve anything equivalent, by act of will, to the accidental irruption of the world.', 'We cannot project more order or disorder into the world than there is.', 'We cannot transform it more than it transforms itself.', 'This is the weakness of our historical radicality.', 'All the philosophies of change, the revolutionary, nihilistic, futurist utopias, all this poetics of subversion and transgression so characteristic of modernity, will appear naive when compared with the instability and natural reversibility of the world.', 'Not only transgression, but even destruction is beyond our reach.', "We shall never, by an act of destruction, achieve the equivalent of the world's accidental destruction.", "What we can add by artificial destruction already falls within the scope of the world's own ceaseless revolution, the ironic trajectory of particles and the chaotic turbulence of natural systems.", 'And the final accident is no more within our power than the initial accident.', 'Here, once again, we must not delude ourselves.', 'We shall add nothing to the nothingness of the world, since we are part of it.', 'But we shall add nothing to its meaning either, since it does not have any.', "Excess is the world's excess, not ours.", 'It is the world that is excessive, the world that is sovereign.', 'This protects us from the illusion of the will, which is also that of faith and desire.', 'The metaphysical illusion of having some effect and frustrating the continuation of the nothing.', 'Our will is like a phantom pregnancy or an artificially innervated prosthesis.', "Or the `virtual' suffering of the phantom limb that follows the amputation of the real one (all virtual reality is the product, like this, of a surgical operation on the real world).", 'The will is of this same order.', 'Its extrapolation into the affairs of the world is merely the extrapolation of desire, or of the suffering of the phantom limb.', 'Dreams, too, give us the illusion that we are in control of them, or can delay their coming to their term.', 'They even give us the illusion of being aware of dreaming, which is part of their mechanism.', 'This is the clinamen of the will interfering with the chromosomes of the dream.', 'As in dreams, the will must espouse this accidental declension of the world -- must inflect, not reflect (on), itself.', 'Must be merely itself an unexpected continuation which perpetuates the event of the world, and perhaps hastens it on its course.', 'Must be in no way different from desire.', 'In Nabokov, in the gracious universe of Ada, as in the tragic universe, there are never any decisions.', 'Everything is made up of -- happy or unhappy -- accidents.', 'There is neither misdeed nor remorse.', 'Everything is immoral and, as a result, so sensual.', 'Not just bodies, but the will itself becomes sensual and accidental.', 'The actors do not believe in their own existence, and do not take responsibility for it.', 'They are happy just to obey the successive promptings of their will and their desire, to respect the enigmatic incidence of these things, while observing certain rules of the game towards existence, the first of which is not to consent to it.', 'Existence is something we must not consent to.', 'It has been given to us as a consolation prize, and we must not believe in it.', 'The will is something we must not consent to.', 'It has been given to us as the illusion of an autonomous subject.', "Now, if there is anything worse than being subject to the law of others, it is surely being subject to one's own law.", 'The real is something we must not consent to.', 'It has been given to us as simulacrum, and the worst thing is to believe in it for want of anything else.', 'The only thing we should consent to is the rule.', 'But in that case, we are speaking not of the rule of the subject, but the rule of the way of the world [jeu du monde].', 'The real, for its part, is merely the natural child of disillusion.', 'Which is itself a secondary illusion.', 'Faith in reality is, of all the imaginary forms, the basest and most trivial.', 'Yet determination is extending its grasp, and the field of what is now ours to decide is expanding daily.', 'We are no longer free not to will.', 'We have to will even where we have no wish to.', 'And why stop there?', "We shouldn't just consult the parents on the choice of sex, but the embryos themselves.", 'Then, at least, the absurdity of the situation would be plain for all to see.', 'The fact is that we are, most often, in a situation of having to decide on matters we know nothing of and have no wish to know anything of.', "The power of others to have control of one's life is an abuse.", "But each person's right and duty to have control of him- or herself is even more dangerous.", 'This is how voluntary servitude has transformed itself into its opposite -- being commanded to desire, commanded to exercise freedom and choice -- which is the consummate form of that servitude.', 'The will is entrapped by the limitless freedom it is accorded, and consents to this out of an illusion of self-determination.', 'Now, the same order reigns over wills as reigns in biology.', 'The same random and automatic regulation applies to wills in our operational universe as applies in the distribution of sexes at birth or in the freely expressed opinions of millions of citizens, which produces the same statistical outcome as would be achieved by consulting monkeys.', 'Where, then, does this wish to substitute the human will for the random course of things come from?', 'There remains, of course, the glory of artifice and of frustrating the natural order.', 'We want to will -- that is the secret -- just as we want to believe and want to be able [pouvoir], because the idea of a world without will, belief and power [pouvoir] is unbearable to us.', 'But most of the time we can will only what has already come to fruition.', 'So the Student of Prague arrives on the duelling ground and his opponent is already dead -- his double has passed that way.', 'Precession of the double, of the involuntary operator of desire.', 'Precession of the event, of the effect over the cause -- metalepsis of the will.', "The anteriority of the will is always stressed, as is the cause's preceding of the effect.", 'But most often, the will merges with the event as its retrospective mise en scène, in the same way as a dream sequence gives expression to the physical sensation of the sleeping body.', 'In any case, whatever one wills, subsequent events will still be of the order of the fateful -- that is, of what happens to you, for good or ill, inadvertently -- though not without some secret connection between them.', 'Why, then, should we will?', 'Why should we desire?', 'We cannot do otherwise.', 'We have to contribute by our desires or our wills to the coming to term of a world in which they have no part.', 'This is our involuntary contribution to our own destinies.', 'According to Nietzsche, this drive is so great in man that for fear of desiring nothing, he will prefer the desire for the nothing, thus making himself, by the deployment of a will without object, the surest agent of that continuity of the nothing which is the continuation of the original crime.', "`Why is there nothing rather than something?'", 'There is, ultimately, no answer to this, since the nothing originates in myth, in the original crime, whereas the something originates in what, by convention, we call reality.', 'Now, the real is never sure.', 'The question then becomes, not `Where does illusion come from?', "', but `Where does the real come from?'", 'How is it that there even is a reality effect?', 'That is the true enigma.', 'If the world was real, how is it that it did not become rational long ago?', 'If it is merely illusion, how can a discourse of reality and the rational even arise?', 'But that is the question.', 'Is there anything but a discourse of the real and the rational?', 'Perhaps there never has been any kind of progress towards more science, consciousness and objectivity, and all this has merely been talk on the part of intellectuals and ideologues who, for three centuries, have derived considerable advantage from it.', 'The same problem arises in the physical sciences.', 'Bruno Jarrosson writes: The first reaction of the fathers of quantum physics at the aberrations coming out of their equations (collapse of the universe of reference: time, space, the principle of identity and of the excluded middle, inseparability, non-locality of particles) was to regard the microscopic world as radically strange and mysterious.', 'Such an interpretation is not, however, the most logical.', 'For the microscopic world is to be accepted as it is.', 'If we cannot derive a conception of the macroscopic world from it, then the mystery lies in the macroscopic world.', 'From that point, we have to think that the strangest thing is not the strangeness of the microscopic world, but the non-strangeness of the macroscopic.', 'Why are the concepts of identity, excluded middle, time and space operative in the macroscopic world?', 'That is what we have to explain.', '(Du micro au macro -- le mystère des évidences) Since the universe of reference has become unintelligible, reason, being part of that universe, cannot but pose the question of its own existence: how can measurable time exist, how can elements and bodies exist separately?', 'Given the uncertainty principle, how can there be an object and a subject of science?', 'Similarly, the real, having become unintelligible, poses an insoluble question for reason, which is part of it: How is it that the concepts of reality, objectivity, truth, causality and identity can function?', 'Why does something seem to exist rather than nothing?', 'But in fact there is nothing.', 'Why is there will rather than no will?', 'But there is no will.', 'There is no real.', "There isn't something.", 'There is nothing.', 'Or, in other words, the perpetual illusion of an ungraspable object and the subject who believes he grasps it.', 'The illusion of a Thing and a rational causality which is, admittedly, comforting to our intellects, but unimaginable in any other universe, including that of particle physics.', 'As Updike says, God is solely responsible for what we can see and hear, but in no way for anything whatever at the microscopic level.', 'So no purpose is served by attempting to reconcile the order of the will with that of the world to the philosophical advantage of the latter.', 'There is the continuity of the world, as it has meaning for us, and the continuity of the world as, in secret, it is nothing and means nothing.', 'This latter does not, strictly speaking, exist.', "It cannot be verified, but can only betray itself, only `show through' [transparaître] like evil, squint out through appearances.", 'There is no dialectic between the two orders.', 'Each is alien to the other.', 'So the world, then, is a radical illusion.', 'That is, at least, one hypothesis.', 'At all events, it is an unbearable one.', 'And to keep it at bay, we have to realize the world, give it force of reality, make it exist and signify at all costs, take from it its secret, arbitrary, accidental character, rid it of appearances and extract its meaning, divert it from all predestination and restore it to its end and its maximum efficacy, wrest it from its form to deliver it up to its formula.', 'This gigantic enterprise of disillusionment -- of, literally, putting the illusion of the world to death, to leave an absolutely real world in its stead -- is what is properly meant by simulation.', 'It is not, then, the real which is the opposite of simulation -- the real is merely a particular case of that simulation -- but illusion.', 'And there is no crisis of reality.', 'Far from it.', 'There will always be more reality, because it is produced and reproduced by simulation, and is itself merely a model of simulation.', 'The proliferation of reality, its spreading like an animal species whose natural predators have been eliminated, is our true catastrophe.', 'This is the inevitable fate of an objective world.', 'We have to restore the potency and the radical meaning of illusion, which is most often reduced to the level of a chimaera diverting us from what is true: what things deck themselves out in to hide what they are.', 'When, in fact, the illusion of the world is the way things have of presenting themselves for what they are when they are not actually there at all.', 'In appearance, things are what they give themselves out to be.', 'They appear and disappear without letting anything at all show through.', 'They unfurl without concern for their being, or even for their existence.', 'They signal to us, but are not susceptible of decipherment.', 'On the other hand, in simulation, in this giant dispositif of meaning, calculation and efficiency that encompasses all our technical devices, including current virtual reality, the illusion of the sign is lost, and only its operation remains.', 'The happy non-distinction between true and false, between real and unreal, gives way to the simulacrum, which consecrates the unhappy non-distinction between true and false, between the real and its signs, the unhappy, necessarily unhappy, destiny of meaning in our culture.', 'We continue to manufacture meaning, even though we know there is none.', 'It remains to be seen, in fact, whether the illusion of meaning is a vital illusion or one that is destructive of the world and the subject itself.', 'However this may be, faced with this strategy on the part of the subject, the world develops a much more subtle and paradoxical one, which is to give itself out for what it is, when it is actually not there.', 'Over against the subject, that indomitable producer of meaning, stands the world, that inexhaustible producer of illusion, including, no doubt -- with the involuntary complicity of the subject -- the illusion of meaning.', 'There will be no end to this frenzied race around the Möbius strip where the surface of meaning perpetually feeds into the surface of illusion, unless the illusion of meaning were to win out once and for all, which would put an end to the world.', 'The whole of our history bears witness to this machinery of reason, which is itself now coming apart.', 'Our culture of meaning is collapsing beneath the excess of meaning, the culture of reality collapsing beneath the excess of reality, the information culture collapsing beneath the excess of information -- the sign and reality sharing a single shroud.', 'They are trying to persuade us that technology will inevitably produce good, to give a role to the artificial environment as a second nature, to select only automatic reflexes in line with a kind of mental genetic code.', 'They are trying to wipe out all the supernatural reflexes of thought, of that thought which reacts instinctively to the illusion of the world, turns appearances back on reality, uses the illusion of the world against the world itself: the Manichaean understanding of evil, the understanding of the world as machination.', 'It is said that the state of nature is unthinkable, because in that state thought does not exist.', 'But this is exactly what we are moving towards: a state of pure operational intelligence, and thus of radical disillusioning of thought.', 'This dream of extirpating all the magic from thought, of eliminating every principle of evil, is as absurd as the dream of eliminating all concupiscence, even in dreams.', 'If the heresy of appearances is our original crime, then every rational impulse to eliminate it is the symptom of a fantastic error on the part of the will, the symptom of an aberration of desire.', 'At all events, illusion is indestructible.', "The world as it is -- which is not at all the `real' world -- perpetually eludes the investigation of meaning, thus causing the present catastrophe of the apparatus of production of the `real' world, so true is it that illusion cannot be combated with truth -- that is merely to redouble the illusion -- but only by a higher illusion.", 'The only response to the phantasmagoria of worlds-beyond, the latest and most subtle of which is the artificial synthesis of this world, is the higher illusion of our world.', 'Every revolution brings about a general involution in a kind of downward spiral.', 'This negative spiral can be countered only by striking an opposite blow, by upping the stakes -- outdoing insignificance with the nothing, the visible with appearance, the false with illusion, evil with greater evil.', 'The radical illusion of the world cannot be dispelled.', 'The illusion of dispelling it is the secondary illusion of the disavowal and transformation of the world.', 'But perhaps, in going to its extreme, that movement gets caught up in its own game and ends up wiping out its own traces, leaving the field free for misappropriation, imperfection, the original crime?', 'Perhaps there is a ruse of the world, just as there is a ruse of history, and rationality and perfection in general might merely be implementing its irrational decree?', 'Sciences and technologies would then merely be an immense, ironic diversion on the horizon of its disappearance.', 'What within truth is merely truth falls foul of illusion.', 'What within truth exceeds truth is of the order of a higher illusion.', 'Only what exceeds reality can go beyond the illusion of reality.', "Trompe-l'oeil Genesis Bertrand Russell's paradox in The Analysis of Mind, in which the world is supposed to have been created only a few minutes ago but peopled with a humanity which remembers an illusory past, is well-known.", "We might, in this connection, revive the hypothesis of P. H. Gosse, the nineteenth -century English naturalist, in his book Omphalos (which Stephen J. Gould discusses in The Flamingo's Smile), that all the geological and fossil traces of the origin and evolution of species, including the human species, are a simulation contemporaneous with the creation of the world by God five thousand years ago, as in the biblical account.", 'Everything which appears to reach back beyond that point, right down into the depths of time, has, he alleges, merely been got up by God in his infinite kindness to bestow an origin and a history upon our world, and is intended to create the illusion of elapsed time.', 'God, argues Gosse, gave men a past in order to soften the unbearable confrontation with the world as it is, the product of an act of force on the part of a higher will.', "We can no longer even imagine the brutality of the creative act, but God has perhaps taken this into account and, in compensation, provided us with a simulacrum of history, to make man's existence bearable to him.", 'Obviously, we can ask: did God really take pity on the human race, or is this merely a gratuitous joke, to mock man once again by holding out before him the forbidden fruit of the knowledge of his own origins, whereas this is in fact merely a mirage?', "Gosse's suggestion is, at all events, extraordinary: to safeguard biblical revelation, he makes God an evil genius of simulation.", 'Is there not a subtle impiety in this?', "God might have contented himself with creating the world, without inventing this trompe-l'oeil anamorphosis.", 'So that could only have been the product of his malicious pleasure.', "This immediately makes him quite a likeable character, even if it does so to future archaeologists' cost, doomed as they will be to live in permanent uncertainty.", "For Gosse argues: `as thoughts in God's mind, solidified in stone by creation ab nihilo, strata and fossils are just as true as if they recorded the products of conventional time'.", 'If the unreal past is no less true than our objective reality, then this latter is no more true than that unreal past.', 'And we can say, with the Ecclesiast, `The simulacrum is not what conceals the truth, it is the truth which conceals that there is none.', "The simulacrum is true.'", 'Fortunately, all this is false, dictated by a blind and illogical faith.', "Yet if we take away the prejudice of faith, and retain only the simulation hypothesis, Gosse's idea opens on to

simulacrum, but it is man who has inherited the evil genius of artifice which was God's.", 'Today the virtual reconstruction of the genesis of the species is the work of human beings themselves, and it is becoming the virtual reality of our past and our future.', 'Not only are our fossils itemized, inventoried, interpreted and reinterpreted according to changing scientific hypotheses and fashions, but the whole thing has taken on the air of cinematic work (editing, framing, lighting, sequences, dissolves) on geological and archaeological material whose objective reality is becoming intangible.', 'It is the same with these relics as it is with those particles in subatomic physics which have no other existence than the traces they leave on our screens.', 'The accumulation of traces and contradictory hypotheses leaves the same aftertaste of uncertainty, of relative credibility.', 'The objectivity of these relics is beyond doubt.', 'The problem is their status as reality and, therefore, as evidence, their status as objects suddenly rendered incredible by the very intensity of their itemization and the methods of analysis applied to them.', "These traces pass into hyperreality, as does any `material' pursued down to the tiniest detail, all `scientific' exploration ending up exterminating its real object.", 'Clearly, it is no longer God overseeing all this, as in Gosse.', 'It is our own apparatus of knowledge, by which we are currently obliterating the traces of our existence, spiriting away the evidence for our sensible world.', 'We have supplanted the God of Omphalos in the invention of a definitively fictitious past.', 'Yet there is a difference in the ways of simulation.', 'For though the illusionist God of Gosse had completely invented the traces of the past of the species, his creation set in train a real world and a history.', 'Once set in place in that creation, things drift on towards their final destinations unaffected by their illusory pasts.', "This special effect of the divine imagination or the Creator's irony has no impact on their present state.", 'We, on the other hand, are no longer part of reality and simulation.', "For us, the question of Adam's navel (which had no reason to exist since he was not born of woman, but which had to be represented in pictures so that the divine arbitrariness of the original act might be erased) no longer even arises: it is the whole of the human race which will have to be rigged out with a trompe-l'oeil navel, in so far as there is no longer any trace, with us, of any umbilical cord which might connect us to the real world.", "We are born of woman still, and shall be for some time to come, but with the coming of in vitro fertilization we shall shortly return to the `anomphalous' condition of Adam: future `humans' will have no navels.", "Metaphorically, we are already in the `umbilical limbo'.", 'Not only have the traces of our past become virtual, but our present itself is given over to simulation.', "It is as though Gosse's God, far more cunning and devilish than Gosse himself imagined him to be, had, as part of his inscrutable, humorous design, extended his divine simulation to the furthermost reaches of the future.", 'Or, alternatively, this simulation of the past might not, after all, be a good practical joke, but the remorseless consequence of the generalized simulation of our present life, the logical extension of our Virtual Reality.', 'Beneath all this theological allegory there lie some very burning problems.', 'It is of some consequence whether this simulation is the work of a beneficent God or the trap set by a malicious one.', 'It is of some consequence whether the virtual illusion upon which we are entering is a beneficent illusion or whether, by moving further in this direction, we are merely getting more and more caught up in the strategem, as a result of what is, on this occasion, a deliberate choice on the part of the human race, fascinated by the idea of inventing an artificial destiny for itself.', 'Or is it that humanity simply dreams of exacting revenge by putting the divine Creation out of joint, debasing it by systematic simulation and turning the universe into a total artefact out of scorn for the Last Judgement?', 'By conjuring away the process of evolution, God had protected man from an inescapable end.', 'For, paradoxically, the only insurance against death is to have been created ex nihilo, which keeps open the possibility of an equally miraculous resurrection, whereas if you are the product of an evolution, the only thing you can do is disappear when your time is up.', 'The intervention of a superior power in Genesis guarantees a future immortality, whereas the genealogy of the species condemns it, in time, to disappear.', "And our whole problem, in our efforts to give birth to a real world, is fundamentally the same as God's: not to drive the human race to despair by the recognition of its real existence and finitude.", "For Gosse, matters are simple: reality exists on God's authority.", 'But what can we do if that same God is capable of simultaneously creating the true and the false?', '(This is not even a diabolical manipulation, since the germ of the illusion came from God himself.)', 'In this case, what is there to guarantee that our world is not as false as the simulacrum of an earlier world?', 'All of reality -- present, past and future -- suddenly comes into doubt.', 'If God is capable of conjuring up a perfect illusion of the pre-Genesis era, then our current reality is eternally unverifiable.', 'It is not, therefore, a scientific hypothesis.', 'The perfect crime is that of an unconditional realization of the world by the actualization of all data, the transformation of all our acts and all events into pure information: in short, the final solution, the resolution of the world ahead of time by the cloning of reality and the extermination of the real by its double.', "This is precisely the theme of Arthur C. Clarke's short story `The Nine Billion Names of God'.", 'A community of Tibetan monks have for centuries devoted themselves to transcribing these nine billion names of God, and once they have

millenarianism, though with no hope of salvation, apocalypse or revelation.', 'Merely hastening the final term, accelerating the movement towards disappearance pure and simple.', "And so, quite

`spectacle' was never irrevocable, even for the Situationists.", 'Whereas unconditional realization is irrevocable, since we are no longer either alienated or dispossessed: we are in possession of all the information.', 'We are no longer spectators, but actors in the performance, and actors increasingly integrated into the course of that performance.', 'Whereas we could face up to the unreality of the world as spectacle, we are defenceless before the extreme reality of this world, before this virtual perfection.', 'We are, in fact, beyond all disalienation.', 'This is the new form of terror, by comparison with which the horrors of alienation were very small beer.', 'In what was the golden age of joyful disillusionment, we carried out the critique of all illusions -- the metaphysical, the religious and the ideological.', 'Only one remains: the illusion of criticism itself.', 'The objects we subjected to the full glare of criticism -- sex, dreams, work, history, power -- have taken their revenge by disappearing, producing, in return, the consoling illusion of truth.', 'Having no more victims to devour, the critical illusion has devoured itself.', 'Even more than the industrial machines, it is the machinery of thought itself that is laid off.', 'At the extreme end of its journey, critical thought has wound back on itself.', 'Where once it was future-orientated, it is now umbilical.', 'In surviving its own self, it in fact helps its object to survive.', 'Just as religion has become definitively realized in other -- irreligious, secular, political and cultural -- forms, where it is impossible to pin it down as religion (including the current revival, where it assumes the mask of religion), so the critique of virtual technologies masks the fact that their concept is seeping everywhere into real life in homoeopathic doses.', 'In denouncing the ghostliness of those technologies -- and of the media -- one implies that there is somewhere an original form of lived existence.', 'Whereas, if the rate of reality is falling every day, this is because the medium itself has passed into life, has become the ordinary ritual of transparency.', 'All this digital,

virtual technology media circus, this perpetual `reality show,' has an ancestor: the ready-made.", "Those who are plucked from their real lives to come and act out the psychodrama of their AIDS or their marital problems on TV have an ancestor in Duchamp's bottle-rack which that artist similarly plucked from the real world to confer on it elsewhere -- in a field we still agree to call art -- an undefinable hyperreality.", 'Paradoxical acting-out, instantaneous short-circuiting.', 'The bottle-rack, exscribed from its context, purpose and function, became more real than reality (hyperreal) and more art than art (transaesthetics of banality, of insignificance, of nullity, against which the pure and indifferent form of art is verified today).', "Any old object, individual or situation is today a virtual ready-made in so far as one can say of anyone or anything what Duchamp was, at bottom, saying of the bottle-rack: it exists, I've met it.", "Everyone is invited, in this same way, to present themselves as they are and play out their lives `live' on-screen, just as the ready-made played out its role exactly as it was, `live' on the gallery screen.", "And the two are merged in the initiative launched by new museums where the aim is not now to bring people to stand in front of the pictures -- which can be done successfully, but isn't interactive enough and smacks too much of the `spectacle' -- but to stand in the pictures -- in the virtual reality of Déjeuner sur l'herbe, for example -- which they can in this way enjoy in real time, possibly even interacting with the work and the figures in it.", "There is the same problem with the TV `reality shows': the viewer has to be brought not in front of the screen (he has always been there, and that is indeed his alibi and refuge) but into the screen, taken to the other side of the information set-up.", 'He has to be made to carry out the same conversion as Duchamp did with his bottle-rack when he transferred it, just as it was, to the other side of art, creating, as he did so, a definitive ambiguity between art and reality.', 'Art today is simply this paradoxical confusion of the two, and the aesthetic intoxication which ensues.', 'Similarly, information is simply the paradoxical confusion of the event and the medium, and the political uncertainty which ensues.', 'So, we have all become ready-mades.', 'Hypostatized like the bottle-rack, our sterile identities taxidermized, we have become living museum pieces, like those entire populations which are transfigured in situ by aesthetic or cultural decree, cloned in our own image by High Definition and condemned, by that exact resemblance, to media stupefaction, just as the ready-made is condemned to aesthetic stupefaction.', "And just as Duchamp's acting-out opens on to the (generalized) zero degree of aesthetics, where any old item of rubbish can be taken as a work of art (which also means that any old work of art can be taken for rubbish), so this media acting-out opens on to a generalized virtuality which puts an end to the real by its promotion of every single instant.", 'The key concept of this Virtuality is High Definition.', 'That of the image, but also of time (Real Time), of music (High Fidelity), of sex (pornography), of thought (Artificial Intelligence), of language (digital languages), of the body (the genetic code and the genome).', "Everywhere, High Definition marks the transition -- beyond any natural determination -- to an operational formula -- and, precisely, a `definitive' one, the transition to a world where referential substance is becoming increasingly rare.", 'The highest definition of the medium corresponds to the lowest definition of the message -- the highest definition of the news item corresponds to the lowest definition of the event, the highest definition of sex (porn) corresponds to the lowest definition of desire, the highest definition of language (in digital coding) corresponds to the lowest definition of meaning, the highest definition of the other (in immediate interaction) corresponds to the lowest definition of otherness and exchange, etc.', 'The high-definition image.', 'This has nothing to do with representation, and even less to do with aesthetic illusion.', 'The whole generic illusion of the image is cancelled out by technical perfection.', 'As hologram or virtual reality or three-dimensional picture, the image is merely the emanation of the digital code which generates it.', 'It is merely the mania for making an image no longer an image or, in other words, it is precisely what removes a dimension from the real world.', 'Already, in moving from the silents to the talkies, then to colour and 3-D and the current range of special effects, the cinematographic illusion faded as the technical prowess increased.', 'No empty space any more, no ellipsis, no silence.', 'The more we move towards that perfect definition, that useless perfection, the more the power of the illusion is lost.', 'To appreciate the truth of this, one only has to think of the Peking Opera and how, with the mere movement of their bodies, the old man and the girl brought to life on the stage the sheer size of the river and how, in the duel scene, the two bodies, skimming each other with their weapons yet not touching, made the darkness in which the duel took place tangible.', 'That was total illusion -- an ecstasy more physical and material than aesthetic or theatrical, precisely because all realist presence of the night or the river had been excised.', 'Today, they would pipe tons of water into the studio, and the duel would be shot in darkness with infra-red cameras.', 'Real Time: instantaneous proximity of the event and its double in information.', 'Proximity of human beings and their remote action: settle all your business at the other end of the world, via an ectoplasmic intermediary.', 'Like every detail of the hologram, every instant of real time is microscopically encoded.', 'Every little bit of time packs in the total information relating to the event, as though it were being mastered in miniature from all sides at once.', 'Now, there is something obscene about the instant replication of an event, act or speech and their immediate transcription, for some degree of delay, pause or suspense is essential to thought and speech.', 'The immediate totting up, itemizing and storing of all these exchanges, precisely as occurs with writing on word-processors, bespeaks an interactive compulsion which respects neither the timing nor the rhythm (not to mention the pleasure) of exchange, and combines artificial insemination and premature ejaculation in the same operation.', 'There is a profound incompatibility between real time and the symbolic rule of exchange.', 'What governs the sphere of communication (the interface, immediacy, the abolition of time and distance) has no meaning in the sphere of exchange, where the rule is that what is given should never be returned immediately.', 'It has to be returned, but never right away.', 'That is a serious, mortal insult.', 'There must never be immediate interaction.', 'It is, precisely, time which separates the two symbolic moments and holds their resolution in abeyance.', "Time with no delay, `live' time, is inexpiable.", 'The whole field of communications is, thus, of the order of the inexpiable, since everything in that field is interactive, is given and returned without delay, without that suspense, minute as it may be, which constitutes the temporal rhythm of exchange.', 'Artificial Intelligence.', 'Thought at last realized, fully materialized by all the virtualities of analysis, synthesis and calculation, just as real time is defined by the ceaseless interaction of all moments and all participants.', 'A high-definition operation: the information which results is truer than truth -- it is true in real time.', 'That is why it is fundamentally uncertain.', 'The fact that Artificial Intelligence veers off into over-high definition, into a crazy sophistication of data and operations, merely confirms that this is indeed the achieved utopia of thought.', 'And now computers controlled by thought are on the way.', 'There is a danger that this extreme form will produce some strange results.', 'At what threshold of consciousness or formalization will the machine intervene?', 'There is a danger that, by reflex anticipation, it will log into subconscious -- if not, indeed, unconscious -- thoughts, into the most primitive phantasies.', 'Like the double of the Student of Prague, who was always there before him, transforming his obscurest whims into acts.', "In this way our `thoughts' will be actualized even before they occur, exactly like the event in the information system.", 'If that is what we must necessarily come to, then the consequence would be that the whole system of thought would soon be aligned to the system of the machine.', 'Thought would end up thinking only what the machine can take in and process, or would think only when the machine requests it.', 'This is already how things stand with computers and information technology.', 'In the generalized interface, thought itself will become virtual reality, the equivalent of computer-generated images or the automatic writing of word-processors.', 'Artificial Intelligence?', 'There is not a shadow of artifice in it, not the shadow of an idea of illusion, seduction or the play of the world, which is much more subtle, perverse and arbitrary.', 'Now, thought is neither a mechanics of higher functions nor a range of operational reflexes.', 'It is a rhetoric of forms, of shifting illusion and appearances -- an anamorphosis of the world, not an analysis.', 'The cerebral, computing machine is not the master of appearances; it is the master only of calculation, and its task, like that of all cybernetic and virtual machines, is to destroy this essential illusion by counterfeiting the world in real time.', 'Just as the illusion of the image disappears into its virtual reality, the illusion of the body into its genetic formulation and the illusion of the world into its artificial technical form, so also do we see disappear, in Artificial Intelligence, the (super)-natural understanding of the world as play, as delusion, as machination, as crime -- and not as logical mechanism, or as reflex cybernetic machine which would have its mirror and model in the human brain.', 'End of the raw illusion of thought, of the scene, of passion, end of the illusion of the world and its vision (and not its representation), end of the illusion of the Other, of Good and Evil (particularly of Evil), of true and false, end of the raw illusion of death, or that of existing at any cost: all these things vanish into telereality, into real time, into the sophisticated technologies which are our initiation into models, into the virtual, into the opposite of illusion -- total disillusion.', 'In the realm of shadows, no one any longer has a shadow, and there is no danger of treading on it and ripping it, as Peter Schlemihl did.', 'What can happen, on the other hand, is for bodies no longer to project their shadows, but shadows to project their bodies, which might then be said to be mere shadows of shadows.', 'This is already the case with our virtual reality, which is merely the putting back into circulation, sub specie corporis, sub specie realitatis, of the abstraction and the digital data of life.', 'As in that other fable where the Devil put the shadow of the student who had sold it to him back into circulation in the living form of the Double, for which the student was then merely the stand-in.', 'This virtual operation of the world is a paradoxical chimaera.', 'The worldwide listing of all data is the same phantasy as that of the spelling of the names of God -- a chimaera in which we bury ourselves

alienation or Heidegger's Gestell.", 'It is the hypothesis of a project of irreversible disappearance in the purest logic of the species.', "The hypothesis of an absolutely real world, where, unlike

to completion, that radical effectuation would be the equivalent of a perfect crime.', "Whereas the `original' crime is never perfect and always leaves traces (we ourselves as living, mortal beings are the trace of that criminal imperfection), future extermination -- that extermination which would be produced by an absolute determination of the world and its elements -- would leave no trace.",

rendering it virtual.', 'For though it lends force to existence and happiness, the concept of reality even more surely lends force of reality to evil and misery.', 'In a real world, death too becomes real, and secretes a commensurate horror.', 'Whereas in a virtual world we dispense with death and birth, as we dispense with a responsibility so diffuse and overwhelming that it becomes impossible to bear.', 'We are doubtless ready to pay this price so as no longer to have perpetually to perform the overwhelming task of distinguishing between true and false, good and evil, etc.', 'The species is, perhaps, collectively ready to reject the moral and metaphysical anguish which ensues from this and has eventually built up into a neurosis, as well as to reject the privilege of critical consciousness, and accept instead a liquidation of differences, categories and values.', 'Perhaps it is ready to abandon transcendence and metaphor for metonymic sequences.', 'No more polarity,

dreams.', 'It is more like an experimental murder in which the murderer and the victim would be mere technical functions.', 'But perhaps the function of disappearing is a vital one.', 'Perhaps this is how we react as living beings, as mortals, to the threat of an immortal universe, the threat of a definitive reality.', 'So this whole array of technology could be taken to mean that man has ceased to believe in his own existence, and has opted for a virtual existence, a destiny by proxy.', "Then all our artefacts become the site of the subject's non-existence, of his desire for non-existence.",

marvellous adventure, just as marvellous in this case as it seems monstrous in the other.', 'It becomes an art of disappearance.', 'It might be seen as aiming not so much to transform the world as to create an autonomous world, a fully achieved world, from which we could at last withdraw.', 'Now, there can be no perfecting of the natural world, and the human being in particular is a dangerous imperfection.', 'If the world is to be perfect, it will first have to be made.', 'And if the human being wishes to attain this kind of immortality, he must produce himself as artefact also, expel himself from himself into an artificial orbit in which he will circle forever.', "So we dream of a world carried along miraculously, without our intervention, and of autonomous beings which, far from escaping our will, as in the story of the sorcerer's apprentice, might fulfil the desire we ourselves have of escaping our will.", 'So we dream of seeing computers reach the stage of intelligent self-programming.', 'And yet, though we concede their becoming more intelligent than us, we do not accord them a will of their own.', 'We do not conceive a rival will in any other species and, if we

contemplate beings we have engendered doing the same.', 'No freedom, no will, no desire, no sexuality -- it is precisely in these respects that we want them perfect.', 'Above all, we cannot grant them

accident and catastrophe.", 'That they have equipped themselves with a number of functional gremlins, electronic viruses and other negative side-effects which protect them from perfection and spare them, in their turn, from pushing to their limits.', 'The perfect crime would have been to invent a faultless world and withdraw from it without leaving a trace.', 'But we cannot achieve this.', "We leave traces everywhere -- viruses, lapses, germs and catastrophes -- signs of imperfection which are, so to speak, man's signature in the heart of the artificial world.", 'Not only Artificial

hypothesis.', 'And since, in any case, even our scientific objectivity is gradually taking on an illusory character these days, there is nothing to stop illusion, for its part, taking an objective turn.', 'The objective illusion is the physical fact that in this universe no things coexist in real time -- not sexes, stars, this glass, this table, or myself and all that surrounds me.', 'By the fact of dispersal and the relative speed of light, all things exist only in a recorded version, in an unutterable disorder of time-scales, at an inescapable distance from each other.', "And so they are never truly present to each other, nor are they, therefore, `real' for each other.", 'The fact of this irremediable distance and this impossible simultaneity, the fact that when I perceive this star it has perhaps already disappeared -- a relationship which can be extended, relatively speaking, to any physical object or living being -- this is the ultimate foundation, the material definition, so to speak, of illusion.', 'The illusion of time is of the same order.', 'It is the objective fact that you are never entirely there at the particular moment, and that integral presence is only ever virtual.', 'If it is true that at any point in time you are in that moment and not elsewhere, you are never at the single point where the whole event might be said to be summed up.',

nothing; everything would be totally crowded together, as it doubtless was in the primal state of the world -- the only state we can say existed in real time, since all matter was coexistent with itself, present to itself at a single point and a single moment.', 'Once that initial (and perfectly hypothetical) state came to an end, the illusion of the world began.', 'After that, the elements were never again to be present to each other.', 'Everything began to exist but, by that very token, did so on the basis of a relative but definitive absence of every thing from every other.', 'Hence on the basis of an irrevocable illusion.', 'That distance, that absence, are today under threat.', 'What is impossible at the cosmic level (that the night should disappear by the simultaneous perception of the light of all the stars) or in the sphere of memory and time (that all the past should be perpetually present, and that events should no longer fade into the mists of time) is

illumination of all moments.', 'In the past, messages faded on a planetary scale, faded with distance.', 'Today we are threatened with lethal sunstroke, with a blinding profusion, by the ceaseless feedback of all information to all points of the globe.', "It's a good thing we ourselves do not live in real time!", "What would we be in `real' time?", 'We would be identified at each moment exactly

others.', 'Now, otherness is that happy distortion without which everyone would simultaneously be me.', 'It is the vital illusion of otherness which prevents the ego from succumbing to absolute reality.', 'Language, too, is what prevents everything from signifying at every moment, and allows us to escape the perpetual irradiation of meaning.', "This specific illusion of language, this poetic function, no longer exists in virtual or digital languages, where the equivalence is total, the interaction as well regulated as in closed question-and-answer circuits and the energy as immediately decodable as a heat source's energy is decodable by water in a pan.", 'These languages are no more languages than the computer-generated image is an image.', 'Fortunately, something in language is irreducible to this computation, something in the subject is irreducible to identification, something in exchange is irreducible to interaction and communication.', 'Even the scientific object is

cannot determine both the velocity and position of a particle is part of the illusion of the object and its perpetual play.', 'Even the particles in the accelerator do not smash into each other in real time, and are not exactly contemporaneous with each other.', 'Modern physics offers us other schemas than that of our reality principle.', 'This latter is based on distinction between things, yet on their correlation within a single space -- their presence one to another.', 'The schema of physics, by contrast, is based on inseparability, yet on the absence of things one from another (they do not interact in a homogeneous space).', 'Particles are inseparable, but light years apart.', "That everything is secretly inseparable, but that nothing truly communicates -- that is to say, nothing passes through the same so-called real world -- that all that is exchanged are singular effects from times and spaces, beings and objects which are not, strictly speaking, `real' for each other (their `reality-in-itself' being forever unintelligible), is the objective illusion of the world.", 'This singularity effect applies to all things -- earthly and stellar, extraordinary or banal, living or inanimate: our perception of them shows them to us definitively distanced from -- and necessarily never getting back to -- their sources.', 'The objective illusion is the impossibility of an objective truth once the subject and object are no longer distinct, and the impossibility of any knowledge based on that distinction.', 'This is the current situation of experimental science -- inseparability of phenomena, inseparability of subject and object.', 'Not that of their magical confusion in so-called irrational thought, but that of the most sophisticated investigation, at the end of which one has to accept the radical enigma of the object, and its disappearance as such.', 'The distinction between subject and object, a fiction that can be maintained in a zone of perception that is on a human scale, breaks down at the level of extreme phenomena and microscopic phenomena.', 'These restore the fundamental inseparability of the two or, in other words, the radical illusion of the world where our cognitive apparatus is concerned.', 'Much has been made of the alteration of the object by the subject in observation.', 'But no one has raised the question of the opposite alteration and its diabolical mirror-effect.', 'Now, the interesting situations are those in which the object slips away, becomes elusive, paradoxical and ambiguous, and infects the subject himself and his analytical procedure with that ambiguity.', 'The main focus of interest has always been on the conditions in which the subject discovers the object, but those in which the object discovers the subject have not been explored at all.', 'We flatter ourselves that we discover the object and conceive it as waiting there meekly to be discovered.', 'But perhaps the cleverer party here is not the one we think.', 'What if it were the object which discovered us in all this?', 'What if it were the object which invented us?', 'This would give us not merely an uncertainty principle, which can be mastered by equations, but a principle of reversibility which is much more radical and more aggressive.', "(Similarly, didn't viruses discover us at least as much as we discovered them, with all the consequences that follow?", "And didn't the American Indians themselves discover us in the end?", 'This is the eternal revenge of the mirror peoples.)', 'These phenomena are not confined to micro-universes.', "In politics, economics and the `human' sciences, the inseparability of subject and object is everywhere resurgent where the simulated objectivity of science had taken hold over the last three centuries.", "It isn't just in physics that it's impossible to calculate the momentum and the position of a particle simultaneously.", "It's the same where the possibility of calculating both the reality and the meaning of an event in news coverage is concerned, the imputation of causes and effects in a particular complex process, the relationship between terrorist and hostage, between virus and cell.", 'Each of our actions is at the same stage as the erratic laboratory particle: we can no longer simultaneously calculate its end and its means.', 'We can no longer simultaneously calculate the price of a human life and its statistical value.', "Uncertainty has filtered into all areas of life: it isn't clear why it might be confined to science alone.", 'And this is not an effect of the complexity of the parameters: that problem we can always surmount.', 'It is a radical uncertainty, because it is linked to the extreme character of phenomena and not just to their complexity.', 'Beyond the limit [ex-terminis], the laws of physics themselves become reversible, and we are no longer in command of the rules, if there are any.', 'At any event, the rules are no longer those of subjects and truth.', 'Since we cannot grasp both the genesis and the singularity of the event, the appearance of things and their meaning, we are faced with an alternative: either we master their meaning, and appearances elude us, or the meaning eludes us, and appearances are saved.', 'Since most of the time the meaning escapes us, this makes it certain that the secret, the illusion which binds us under the seal of secrecy, will never be unmasked.', 'This is not something mystical but something that arises from an active strategy of the world towards us -- a strategy of absence and relinquishment, as a result of which, by the very play of appearances, things stray further and further from their meaning, and doubtless further and further from each other also, the world accentuating its flight into strangeness and the void.', 'While physicists seek the equations which would unify all physical forces, the galaxies continue to move apart at fabulous speeds.', 'While semiotics seeks a unified theory of the linguistic field, languages and signs continue to move apart like galaxies, as an effect of some sort of linguistic Big Bang, but always remaining secretly inseparable.', 'The illusion of the world -- its enigma -- also derives from the fact that for the poetic imagination, the imagination concerned with appearances, it is there in its entirety at a stroke, whereas for analytical thought it has an origin and a history.', 'Now, everything which appears at a stroke, without historical continuity, is unintelligible.', 'None of the means by which we aspire to elucidate it can change anything of the original coup de force, of this sudden irruption into appearance which the will to transparency and information vainly seek to resolve.', 'If the world has a history, we can hope to get a final explanation out of it.', 'If, on the other hand, it was born at a stroke, it is not susceptible of having an end set to it -- we are protected from its end by this non-meaning which takes on the force of poetic illusion.', 'Illusion, being pre-eminently the art of appearing, of emerging from nothing, protects us from being.', 'And being also pre-eminently the art of disappearing, it protects us from death.', 'The world is protected from its end by its diabolic indeterminacy.', 'By contrast, all that is determinate is condemned to be exterminated.', 'Two orders of thinking hover around this ontological obstacle.', "For the one, classical and `rational', the only hypothesis is that of an evolution and a progress of living forms.", 'For the other, which is highly improbable (with no hope of proof), the biomass appeared at a stroke -- the Big Bang of living matter -- and is present in its entirety from the beginning (even if the history of complex forms was then to follow).', 'Exactly like language in Lévi-Strauss: the logomass, the mass of signifier, emerges at a stroke, in its entirety.', 'Nothing further will be added in terms of information.', 'There is even too much -- an excess of signifier, which will never be reduced.', 'Once it has appeared, it is, like the biomass, indestructible.', 'As indestructible as mass itself, as the material substance of the world and, closer to us, the sociological masses whose just as sudden and unpredictable appearance is also irreversible, up until their possible collapse.', 'Astromass, biomass, logomass, sociomass -- all of these are doubtless destined to come to an end, though not gradually but, rather, by a breakdown which is, like their appearance, sudden.', 'Cultures also invent themselves at a stroke -- their emergence is inexplicable in evolutionistic terms.', 'They have all their intensity at the outset, and they disappear very quickly -- sometimes even suddenly, and without any apparent reason (only ours seems inclined to go on for ever).', 'As for the world of the mind, it functions according to the same catastrophic rule: everything is there from the outset, it is not negotiated stage by stage.', 'It is like the rules of a game -- perfect the way it is, any idea of progress or change being absurd.', 'And, by the same token, one cannot imagine the illusion coming about gradually, the world becoming progressively more and more of an illusion (one can, on the other hand, imagine it increasingly taking itself for real, and becoming so in its own eyes).', 'We have, then, to propose the same hypothesis of a total, unpredictable and definitive emergence: the level of illusion could neither grow nor diminish, since it is coextensive with the world as appearance.', 'The illusion is the world-effect itself.', 'This suddenness, this emergence from the void, this non-anteriority of things to themselves, continues to affect the event of the world at the very heart of its historical unfolding.', 'What constitutes an event is what breaks with all previous causality.', 'The event of language is what makes it re-emerge miraculously every day, as a finished form, outside of all previous significations.', 'Photography, too, is the art of dissociating the object from any previous existence and capturing its probability of disappearing in the moment that follows.', 'In the end, we prefer the ab nihilo, prefer what derives its magic from the arbitrary, from the absence of causes and history.', 'Nothing gives us greater pleasure than what emerges or disappears at a stroke, than emptiness succeeding plenitude.', 'Illusion is made up of this magic portion, this accursed share which creates a kind of absolute surplus-value by subtraction of causes or by distortion of effects and causes.', 'This machination of the Nothing, which means that things contradict their very reality, may be conceived either as poetic or as criminal.', 'All that is unintelligible is criminal in substance, and all thinking which fuels this enigmatic machination is the perpetuation of this crime.', 'If the world is without reference and without ultimate reason, why do you expect thought to have these things?', 'The Secret Vestiges of Perfection The hope of theory is that, by impressing upon formalism a sufficiently high degree of symmetry, while preserving its coherence, it might be possible to determine the perfect equation of the world in unequivocal fashion.', 'Once that task has been completed, it is right and proper to destroy the equation immediately.', 'The necessary feat of symmetry-breaking -- the passage from perfection to imperfection -- is accomplished in physics by a most artful procedure.', 'One abstracts, first of all, from the clumsy appearances of reality, to render it consonant with the canon of classical beauty, then one breaks, one by one, the symmetries of absolute beauty in order to make the model resemble the sensible appearance.', '(Michel Cassé, Du Vide et de la Création) At the extreme original temperatures (the hypothetical ones of the Big Bang), particles and anti-particles are

favour of the minimal energy of reality.', "The cooling of the universe is accompanied by a restricted materiality, governed, at last, by a few verifiable physical laws (including, with the emergence of light, the possibility of observation, and thus of an `objectivity' of the world).", "Before this material `objectivity', then, there is the primal void, which is defined as a space without any real particles.", 'Not nothingness but an ocean of virtual particles, which give it an energy of its own, a potential energy, which is nothing, but can transform itself into everything that is.', 'A capricious energy, from before the precipitation of matter into the cycle of causes and effects.', 'Such is the Nothing, the Void, primal scene of the material illusion, and continuation of the Nothing as perpetuation of that state.', 'This enables us to sketch out what illusion is, as opposed to the real.', 'Illusion is the quality of a world which, by the antinomic structure of matter, retains the potentiality of the nullification and immaterial return of energy.', "Illusion is the characteristic of what retains the possibility of wiping itself out by a violent reversion

distinct, linked to each other, only by virtue of the possibility of cancelling each other out).", 'Only energy bound to restricted materiality -- to our materiality -- is doomed to dissipation and entropy.', 'The original void is amorphous, sterile, homogeneous, symmetrical.', 'It is perfect.', 'No reality can emerge there.', 'It is absolute illusion.', 'This symmetry has to be broken if a law-governed materiality is to establish itself -- an imperfection, in which real bodies emerge (but where can such an imperfection possibly come from?', 'What sets off breakings of symmetry?).', 'Of that imperfection, we -- human beings -- are the trace, since perfection is of the order of the inhuman.', 'We are also, however, the heirs of the Void, of the Nothing, of that primal scene of absence, that perfectly indecipherable and enigmatic state of the Universe -- a situation which will never be compensated for by the real and the hegemony of the real.', 'We are the heirs both to symmetry and to breakings of symmetry, and our imperfection is as radical as the radical illusion of the Void can be.', 'On the further slope looms the perfect crime: the destruction of all illusion, saturation by absolute reality.', 'All traces of the initial state are wiped away.', 'With the venture of technology, we are embarked upon the completion of what began with the dispersion of the initial void: the annihilation of the void, of that perfect illusion, in the name of an achieved reality -- the equivalent of total entropy -- to be completed at some unknowable date.', 'But this may be unforeseeably hastened, as a function of the process of increasing information.', 'For this latter, contrary to the negentropic illusion of information theory, is itself part of entropic dissipation, of that destiny of restricted materiality, that destiny of greater visibility, transparency and hypercoincidence which takes us ever further from the initial conditions and brings us closer to the final solution.', 'Unless....', "Unless, perhaps, we rediscover -- coming to a deeper understanding of the essence of technology, as Heidegger conceives it -- `the stellar course of the mystery'.", 'Unless, perhaps, indestructible illusion awaits us at the end of the process.', 'Are we not dealing, through our hypertechnologies, with the transformation of all matter into virtuality, into information, into irradiation?', 'And the world will be seen to have taken on force of reality, force of materiality, only for an intermediate phase, in which there was a possibility of establishing a few laws, a few physical constants that are already becoming problematic at sub-atomic level.', 'Perhaps, in our reality effects, we are merely obeying a gravitational effect that is the opposite of the prodigious anti-gravitational effect at the origin of the Universe and its expansion.', 'And why might that fundamental anti-gravity not still be at work?', 'Should we not, then, in accordance with a new physics, grant primacy not to the attraction of the solid body towards the centre, but to the attraction of the void towards the periphery?', 'The Height of Reality We labour under the illusion that it is the real we lack the most, but actually, reality is at its height.', 'By our technical exploits, we have reached such a degree of reality and objectivity that we might even speak of an excess of reality, which leaves us far more anxious and disconcerted than the lack of it.', 'That we could at least make up for with utopianism and imagination, whereas there is neither compensation for -- nor any alternative to -- the excess of reality.', 'No longer any possible negation or surpassing, since we are already beyond.', 'No longer any negative energy arising from the imbalance between the ideal and the real -- only a hyperreaction, born of the superfusion of the ideal and the real, of the total positivity of the real.', 'However, even though we have gone beyond the real, into virtual accomplishment, we still have the unpleasant impression of having missed the end.', 'The whole of modernity had as its aim the coming of this real world, the liberation of men and of real energies, bent upon an objective transformation of the world, beyond all the illusions with which critical analysis has kept philosophy and practice fed.', 'Today, the world has become real beyond our wildest expectations.', 'The real and the rational have been overturned by their very realization.', 'Such a proposition may seem paradoxical when we look at all the traces of the unfinished nature of the world, the traces of penury and poverty, such that one might think it had barely begun to evolve towards a more real, more rational state.', 'But we have to leap ahead of ourselves: this systematic practicalization of the world has gone very quickly, the system actualizing all the utopian potential and substituting the radicalism of its operation for the radicalism of thought.', 'There is no point taking refuge in the defence of values, even critical ones.', 'That is politically correct, but intellectually anachronistic.', 'What we must do is think this unconditional realization of the world, which is at the same time its unconditional simulacrum.', 'What we lack most is a conceptualization of the completion of reality.', 'This paradoxical configuration of an achieved universe imposes another mode of thinking than the critical.', 'A thinking that goes beyond the end, a thinking of extreme phenomena.', 'Up to now, we have thought an incomplete reality, shot through with negativity; we have thought what was lacking in reality.', 'Today, we have to think a reality which lacks nothing, individuals who potentially lack nothing and therefore can no longer dream of a dialectical sublation.', 'Or rather, the dialectic has indeed fulfilled itself, but ironically, one might say, not at all by taking in the negative, as in the dream of critical thought, but in a total, irrevocable positivity.', 'By absorption of the negative, or quite simply by the fact that the negative, denying itself, has merely generated a redoubled positivity.', 'Thus, the negative disappears in substance and, if the dialectic has run its course, it has done so in the parodic mode of its elimination, by the ethnic cleansing of the concept.', "So we are still forced to think this pure positivity, to think the `depassed real' (as one speaks of a `depassed coma') and no longer the peaceful surpassing of the real or its doubling in the imaginary.", 'It is not certain that we possess the necessary concepts to think this fait accompli, this virtual performance of the world which is tantamount to the elimination of all negation, that is, a pure and simple de-negation.', 'What can critical thought, thought based on the negative, do against the state of denegation?', 'Nothing.', 'To think extreme phenomena, thought must itself become an extreme phenomenon; it must abandon any critical pretensions, any dialectical illusions, any rational hope, and move, like the world, into a paradoxical phase, an ironic and paroxystic phase.', 'It has to be more hyperreal than the real, more virtual than virtual reality.', 'The simulacrum of thought has to move more quickly than the others.', 'Since we can no longer multiply the negative by the negative, we have to multiply the positive by the positive.', 'One has to be even more positive than the positive to take in both the total positivity of the world and the illusion of that pure positivity.', 'Nothing has the same meaning any more once it has been confronted not with its unfinished form, but with its accomplished or even excessive form.', 'We are no longer fighting the spectre of alienation, but that of ultra-reality.', 'We are no longer fighting our shadows, but transparency.', 'And every step in technological progress, every advance in information and communications, brings us closer to that inescapable transparency.', 'All the signs have been reversed as a result of this precession of the end, this irruption of the final term at the very heart of things and their unfolding.', 'The same acts, the same thoughts and the same hopes which brought us nearer to that finality we so longed for now take us away from it, since it is behind us.', 'Similarly, everything changes meaning once the movement of History crosses this fatal demarcation line: the same events have different meanings depending on whether they take place in a history that is being made or in a history being unmade.', "It's the same with the curve of History as it is with the trajectory of reality.", 'It is the upward movement which gives them force of reality.', 'On the downward curve -- or because the movement is simply continuing as a result of its own inertia -- everything is caught in a different refraction space, as in a gravity alternator.', "In that new space, as in Alice's looking-glass space, words and effects are stood on their head, and every movement impedes every other.", 'The balance which, by the force of the negative, governed our world has been upset.', 'Events, discourses, subjects or objects exist only within the magnetic field of value, which only exists as a result of the tension between two poles: good or evil, true or false, masculine or feminine.', 'It is these values, now depolarized, which are beginning to spin in the undifferentiated field of reality.', 'And objects, too, are beginning to spin in the undifferentiated field of value.', 'All there is now is a circular form of switching or substitution between disconnected and erratic values.', 'Everything which stood in a fixed relation of opposition is losing its meaning by becoming indistinguishable from its opposite as a result of the upsurge of a reality which is absorbing all differences and conflating opposing terms by promoting them all unreservedly.', 'With everything losing its distance, its substance, its resistance in the in-different acceleration of the system, crazed values are beginning to produce their opposites, or to eye each other longingly.', 'And so the transparence of Evil is merely the transpiration of the worst through the best.', 'Nothing is more entertaining than the fact that Evil comes out of Good.', "But isn't there an equal irony in the fact that Good comes out of Evil?", 'We have, in fact, to look at things differently.', 'Good is when Good comes out of Good, or Evil out of Evil.', 'That is when there is order.', 'Evil is when Evil comes out of Good, or Good out of Evil.', 'That is when things are all wrong.', 'It is as though the cells of the heart were producing liver cells.', 'Every discrepancy between cause and effect is of the order of Evil.', 'The extermination of the negative is, therefore, the final solution.', 'But the die is not cast.', 'The destiny of the positive, of a system culminating in positivity and pure speculation, remains, itself, enigmatic.', 'By a form of secret coherence, one finds there a kind of balance of Evil, a kind of syllogism of the Void and Absence -a dialectics of nullity.', 'In his Flüchtlingsgespräche, Brecht has two refugees in transit talking over a beer in a station buffet.', "Ziffer says: `This beer isn't a beer.", "But the fact that this cigar isn't a cigar either makes up for that.", "If the beer weren't a beer, but the cigar were a cigar, then things would be all wrong.'", 'So order is established out of the harmonious compensating effect of several disorders.', 'This is the ironic version of the double negative.', "In the French expression `bête et méchant', the fact of being nasty is harmonious compensation for the fact of being stupid -- there is no longer any scandal about it; logic remains intact.", 'We have here the subtle equilibrium of the negative, the balancing of Evil by Evil.', 'Though this does not find an equivalent in the balancing of Good by Good, since that is the utopia of an ideal world, of the ideal good -- precisely the utopia of stupidity.', 'So the world goes its way naturally, by a logical enchainment of Evil which seems much more capable of accounting for it than the opposite enchainment of Good.', "In the same dialogue, Brecht writes: `When, in the wrong place, there is something, that's disorder.", "When, in the right place, there is nothing, that's order.'", 'So the dialectic follows its course -- not towards an ideal solution, but towards a null order, and the self-evidence of the world as the self-evidence of a zero-sum equation.', 'A dialectique du pire, but a well-tempered dialectic none the less.', 'The only one you can rely on with certainty.', 'It is a good thing, in the end, that, in the right place, there is nothing rather than something.', 'If this dialectics of nullity is more reliable, this is because it corresponds profoundly to the symbolic rule.', 'Nothing is exchanged in terms of positive equivalence -- the only things really exchanged are absence and the negative.', 'Evil has to be given and returned for human beings to be bound by a profound reciprocity.', 'Such is the economy of the accursed share, of which the nothing, the evil, the irreducible and absence are the symbolic operators.', "So, when, in the right place (in the streets in May '68), something happens, there is disorder.", 'But is there not equal disorder if, where something should have happened (on the screens during the Gulf War), nothing happens?', 'No pictures and, strictly speaking, no war.', 'But the non-happening of the pictures was secretly in tune with the non-happening of the war, to the point that there too everything was in order, as in the story of the beer and the cigar.', 'Is it better to be where you should not be, but where there is something to see (elsewhere than in front of your television) or where you should be, but where there is nothing to see (in front of the screen)?', 'Our critical morality tends to make something emerge in place of nothing -- the subject in place of the object.', 'But the true challenge is to be nothing rather than something, not to be there where there should be someone: a strategy of nonhappening, stratégie du pire, strategy of illusion, strategy of seduction.', 'There is perhaps some affectation in this, but where there is affectation, there is pleasure.', 'The idea, on the other hand, that a thing is precisely where it should be, that something is precisely what it must be -- the objective point of view of order -- is inconceivable.', 'There is no possibility of that order in a real world.', 'There is, at any rate, no possibility of being oneself.', 'There is no possibility of ideas being themselves.', 'If they come to pass, they do so disavowing themselves.', 'Everything which becomes reality runs counter to its own concept.', "Thus, in the Flüchtlingsgespräche, it is also said that though the beer isn't a beer, though the cigar isn't a cigar, though the man is no longer a man, the passport, for its part, still remains a passport.", 'The man is without identity, but the passport which identifies him is identical to itself.', 'Now, the passport is also the mark of exile, and so the only thing which identifies him simultaneously bears witness to the fact that the man has become foreign to himself.', 'In our universe of all dreams, of all desires, there is no other destiny than this disavowal of the idea, of the concept or the dream.', "The passport is there, but at what is, in the passport's terms, the right place, there is nothing.", 'Things are in order.', 'The present world exceeds the grasp of criticism in that it is caught up in a perpetual movement of disillusion and dissolution, the very movement which is pushing it towards order and towards an absurd conformism, the excess of which creates much greater disorganization than the opposite excess of disorder.', 'Having reached this point, the real (if we may call it that) now responds only to a kind of objective irony and pataphysical description.', 'Pataphysics is the imaginary science of our world, the imaginary science of excess, of excessive, parodic, paroxystic effects -- particularly the excess of emptiness and insignificance.', 'The existence which believes in its own existence is an infatuation, a ridiculous flatulence.', 'Pataphysical irony is aimed at this presumptuousness on the part of beings sustained by the fierce illusion of their existence.', "For that existence is merely an inflatable structure, similar to Ubu's belly, which distends into the void and ends up exploding like the Palotins.", 'There is irony in all extreme processes, in all processes of involution, collapse, inflation, deflation, reversibility.', 'An irony which plays not on negation but on empty positivity, on exponential platitude, to the point where the process turns around of its own accord and rediscovers the splendour of the void.', 'At the peak of our technological performance, the irresistible impression remains that something eludes us -- not because we seem to have lost it (the real?', '), but because we are no longer in a position to see it: that, in effect, it is not we who are winning out over the world, but the world which is winning out over us.', 'It is no longer we who think the object, but the object which thinks us.', "Once we lived in the age of the lost object; now it is the object which is `losing' us, bringing about our ruin.", 'We very much labour under the illusion that the aim of technology is to be an extension of man and his power; we labour under the subjective illusion of technology.', 'But today, this operating principle is thwarted by its very extension, by the unbridled virtuality we see outrunning the laws of physics and metaphysics.', 'It is the logic of the system which, carrying it beyond itself, is altering its determinations.', 'At the same time as reaching a paroxystic stage, things have also reached a parodic one.', 'All our technologies might, therefore, be said to be the instrument of a world which we believe we rule, whereas in fact the world is using this machinery to impose itself, and we are merely the operators.', 'An objective illusion, then, similar to the one that prevails in the media sphere.', 'The naive illusion about the media is that the political authorities use them to manipulate or mystify the masses.', 'The opposite hypothesis is more subtle.', 'Through the media, it is the masses who definitively modify the exercise of power (or what sees itself as such).', 'It is at the point where the political authorities think they are manipulating them that the masses impose their clandestine strategy of neutralization and destabilization.', 'Even if the two hypotheses are simultaneously valid, this is still the end of media Reason, the end of political Reason.', 'Everything which will be done or said in the media sphere is, from this point on, ironically undecidable.', 'The same hypothesis holds for the object of science.', 'Through the most refined procedures we deploy to pin it down, is it not the object which dupes us and mocks our objective pretensions to analyse it?', 'Scientists themselves are not, it seems, far from admitting this.', 'Can one advance the hypothesis that beyond the objective and critical phase there is an ironic phase of science, an ironic phase of technology?', 'A proposition which would deliver us from the Heideggerian vision of technology as the final phase of metaphysics, from the retrospective nostalgia for being and from all unhappy critique in terms of alienation and disenchantment.', 'And would put in its place a conception of the gigantic objective irony of this whole process, which would not be far from radical snobbery, from the post-historical snobbery Kojève spoke of.', 'It seems, in fact, that though the illusion of the world has been lost, the irony of the world, for its part, has passed into things.', 'It seems that technology has taken into itself all the illusion it has caused us to lose, and that what we have in return for the loss of illusion is the emergence of an objective irony of this world.', 'Irony as universal form of disillusionment, but also as the universal form of the stratagem by which the world hides behind the radical illusion of technology, and by which the mystery (of the continuation of the Nothing) conceals itself beneath the universal banality of information.', "Heidegger: `When we look into the ambiguous essence of technology, we behold the constellation, the stellar course of the mystery.'", 'The Japanese sense the presence of a divinity in every industrial object.', 'For us, that sacred presence has been reduced to a tiny ironic glimmer, a nuance of play and distantiation.', 'Though this is, none the less, a spiritual form, behind which lurks the evil genius of technology which sees to it itself that the mystery of the world is well-guarded.', 'The Evil Spirit keeps watch beneath artefacts and, of all our artificial productions, one might say what Canetti says of animals: that behind each of them there is a hidden someone thumbing his nose at us.', 'Irony is the only spiritual form in the modern world, which has annihilated all others.', 'It alone is the guardian of the mystery, but it is no longer ours to exercise.', 'For it is no longer a function of the subject; it is an objective function, that of the artificial, object world which surrounds us, in which the absence and transparency of the subject is reflected.', 'The critical function of the subject has given way to the ironic function of the object.', 'Once they have passed through the medium or through the image, through the spectrum of the sign and the commodity, objects, by their very existence, perform an artificial and ironic function.', 'No longer any need for a critical consciousness to hold up the mirror of its double to the world: our modern world swallowed its double when it lost its shadow, and the irony of that incorporated double shines out at every moment in every fragment of our signs, of our objects, of our models.', 'No longer any need to confront objects with the absurdity of their functions, in a poetic unreality, as the Surrealists did: things move to shed an ironic light on themselves all on their own; they discard their meanings effortlessly.', 'This is all part of their visible, all too visible sequencing, which of itself creates a parody effect.', 'The aura of our world is no longer sacred.', 'We no longer have the sacred horizon of appearances, but that of the absolute commodity.', 'Its essence is promotional.', 'At the heart of our universe of signs there is an evil genius of advertising, a trickster who has absorbed the drollery of the commodity and its mise en scène.', 'A scriptwriter of genius (capital itself?)', 'has dragged the world into a phantasmagoria of which we are all the fascinated victims.', "All metaphysics is swept away by this turnabout in which the subject is no longer the master of representation (`I'll be your mirror'), but the operator of the objective irony of the world.", 'It is, henceforth, the object which refracts the subject and imposes upon it its presence and its random form, its discontinuity, its fragmentation, its stereophony and its artificial instantaneity.', 'It is the power of the object which cuts a swathe through the very artifice we have imposed on it.', 'There is something of revenge in this: the object becomes a strange attractor.', 'Stripped of all illusion by technology, stripped of all connotation of meaning and value, exorbitated -- i. e. taken out of the orbit of the subject -- it is then that it becomes a pure object, superconductive of illusion and non-meaning.', "We are faced, ultimately, with two irreconcilable hypotheses: that of the extermination of all the world's illusion by technology and the virtual, or that of an ironic destiny of all science and all knowledge in which the world -- and the illusion of the world -- would survive.", "The hypothesis of a `transcendental' irony of technology being by definition unverifiable, we have to hold to these two irreconcilable and simultaneously `true' perspectives.", 'There is nothing which allows us to decide between them.', "As Wittgenstein says: `The world is everything which is the case'.", 'Machinic Snobbery Nothing is perfect, because it is opposed to nothing.', 'There is nothing to say about Warhol, and Warhol has said just this in all his interviews and in his Journal, without rhetoric, without irony, without commentary -- he alone being able to refract the insignificance of his images and his doings into the insignificance of his discourse.', 'It is for this reason that whatever light one casts on the object Warhol, the Warhol effect, there is always something enigmatic about him which wrenches him out of the paradigm of art and the history of art.', 'The enigma is that of an object which offers itself up in total transparency, and hence cannot be naturalized by critical or aesthetic discourse.', 'It is that of a superficial, artificial object which succeeds in preserving its artificiality, in shaking free of any natural signification to take on a spectral intensity, empty of meaning, which is that of the fetish.', 'The fetish object, as we know, has no value.', 'Or rather, it has an absolute value; it lives off the ecstasy of value.', "Each of Warhol's images is thus insignificant in itself and of absolute value; it has the value of a figure from which all transcendent desire has withdrawn, leaving room only for the immanence of the image.", 'It is in this sense that it is artificial.', 'Warhol was the first to bring us modern fetishism, transaesthetic fetishism -- that of an image without quality, a presence without desire.', 'Warhol starts out from any old image, eliminates its imaginary dimension and makes it a pure visual product.', 'Those who work on scientific, video or computer-generated images do exactly the opposite.', 'They use the raw material and the machine to remake art.', 'Warhol is a machine.', 'He is the true machinic metamorphosis.', 'The others exploit technology to create illusion.', 'Warhol offers us the pure illusion of technology -- technology as radical illusion -- an illusion far superior today to that of painting.', "Warhol's images are banal not because they might be said to be the reflection of a banal world, but because they are products of the absence of any interpretative pretension on the part of the subject.", 'They are products of the elevation of the image to pure figuration, without the least transfiguration.', 'Not transcendence any longer, but the rise and rise of the sign which, losing all natural signification, shines forth in the void with the full gleam of its artificial light.', 'In the mystical vision, the illumination of the slightest detail comes from the divine intuition which lights it, the sense of a transcendence which inhabits it.', 'For us, by contrast, the stupefying exactness of the world comes from the sense of an essence fleeing it, a truth which no longer inhabits it.', 'It comes from a minutely detailed perception of the simulacrum and, more precisely, of the media and industrial simulacrum.', 'Such is Warhol and his serial hypostasis of the image, of the pure and empty form of the image, its ecstatic, insignificant iconry.', 'He is at once both our new mystic and the absolute anti-mystic, in the sense that every detail of the world, every image, remains initiatory, but initiatory into nothing at all.', 'This fetishistic transmutation separates Warhol from Duchamp and all his predecessors.', 'For Duchamp, Dada, the Surrealists and all who worked to deconstruct representation and smash the work of art are still part of an avant-garde, and belong, in one way or another, to the critical utopia.', 'For us moderns, at any rate, art has ceased to be an illusion; it has become an idea.', 'It is no longer idolatric now, but critical and utopian, even when -- particularly when -- it demystifies its object or when, with Duchamp, it aestheticizes at a stroke, with its bottle-rack, the whole field of daily reality.', 'This is still true of a whole segment of Pop Art, with its lyrical vision of popcorn or comic strips.', 'Banality here becomes the criterion of aesthetic salvation, the means of exalting the creative subjectivity of the artist.', 'Obliterating the object the better to mark out the ideal space of art and the ideal position of the subject.', 'But Warhol belongs to no avant-garde and to no utopia.', "And if he settles utopia's hash, he does so because, instead of projecting it elsewhere, he takes up residence directly at its heart, that is, at the heart of nowhere.", 'He is himself this no place: this is how he traverses the space of the avant-garde and, at a stroke, completes the cycle of the aesthetic.', 'This is how he at last liberates us from art and its critical utopia.', 'Modern art had gone a very long way in the deconstruction of its object, but it is Warhol who has gone furthest in the annihilation of the artist and the creative act.', 'That is his snobbery, but it is a snobbery which relieves us of all the affectation of art.', 'Precisely because it is machine-like.', 'In Picabia and Duchamp, the machine is still present as surrealist mechanicity, not as machinality -- not, in other words, as the automatic reality of the modern world.', 'Whereas Warhol identifies purely and simply with the machinic, which is what gives his images their contagious power.', 'Other artists, even if they flirt with banality, do not have this same chain-reaction power of images.', 'This is because they have not become true snobs.', 'They are merely artists.', 'Their works go only halfway down the path of artifice.', 'Though they too have lost the secret of representation, they do not draw the consequences from this, consequences which may indeed, in machinic snobbery, involve a kind of suicide.', 'With Warhol we have the minimum pretension to being, the minimum strategy of means and ends.', "One should read Warhol's Journal -- the whole of it -- as the finest account of this transparency, this meticulous expressionlessness, this will to insignificance which is doubtless our contemporary version of the will to power.", "Behind what some have chosen to see as obsession or urbanity:... it's all there.", 'The affectless gaze.', 'The diffracted grace...', 'The bored languor, the wasted pallor...', 'The chic freakiness, the basically passive astonishment, the enthralling secret knowledge...', 'The childlike, gum-chewing naïveté, the glamour rooted in despair, the self-admiring carelessness, the perfected otherness, the wispiness, the shadowy, voyeuristic, vaguely sinister aura, the pale, soft-spoken magical presence, the skin and bones.', 'This is perhaps, secondarily, why one can multiply a Warhol image to infinity, but cannot get greater depth from a detail.', 'To my knowledge, there are no blown-up details of a Warhol work.', 'The fact is that each one already functions like a hologram, where there is no difference between the detail and the whole, where the gaze spreads and diffuses into an insubstantial object to the point of merging with its virtual presence.', 'Warhol himself was never anything but a kind of hologram.', 'Famous people came to the Factory to hover around him without being able to get anything from him, but they tried to pass through him as you might with a filter or a camera lens, which is what he had in effect become.', 'Valerie Solanas was even to try to shatter that lens by shooting at it, to pass through the hologram to establish that blood could still flow from it.', "So we can agree with Warhol: `You can't get more superficial than me and live'.", "And he nearly didn't come out of it alive.", 'Everything in Warhol is phoney: the object is phoney because it is no longer related to the subject but solely to the desire for an object.', "The image is phoney because it no longer has any relation to an aesthetic exigency, but solely to the desire for an image (and Warhol's images desire and engender each other).", 'In this sense, Warhol is the first artist to have reached the stage of radical fetishism, the stage beyond that of alienation -- the paradoxical stage of an otherness raised to perfection.', 'This is what earned him that quite peculiar form of fascination which fetishes alone attract, that fetishistic aura which attaches to the singularity of the void.', 'And the famous fifteen minutes of fame he spoke of was only ever the ability to accede to that extreme insignificance -- that insignificance which generates a vacuum all around it, and towards which all desires are thus irresistibly drawn.', 'It is not so easy, that insignificance.', "In the empty space of desire, the seats don't come cheap.", 'Fetishes communicate with each other by the omnipotence of thought and with the rapidity of dreams.', 'Whereas there is a deferred relationship between signs, there is an immediate chain reaction between fetishes because they are made of an indifferent mental substance.', 'We see this in fashion items, where the transmission is unreal and instantaneous because they do not have meaning.', 'Ideas, too, can have this mode of transmission: they just have to be fetishized.', 'Let us not be deceived about the cool forms, forms indifferent to themselves, which this fetishism can assume in Warhol.', 'Behind this machinic snobbery, what is really going on is a rise and rise of objects, images, signs and simulacra, as well as a rise and rise of values, the finest example of which is the art market itself.', 'We are a long way from the alienation of price, which is still a real measure of things.', 'We are in the ecstasy of value, which explodes the notion of market and simultaneously destroys the art work as such.', 'Warhol is naturally party to this extermination of the real by the image, and to such an overdoing of the image as to put an end to all aesthetic value.', 'Warhol reintroduces nothingness into the heart of the image.', 'In this sense, we cannot say he is not a great artist: fortunately for him, he is not an artist at all.', 'The point of his work is a challenge to the very notion of art and aesthetics.', 'The reign of art is the reign of a conventional management of illusion, of a convention which contains the frenzied effects of illusion, which exorcizes illusion as an extreme phenomenon.', 'Aesthetics restores mastery over the order of the world to a subject, restores a form of sublimation of the total illusion of the world, which would otherwise annihilate us.', 'Other cultures have accepted the cruel self-evidence of this illusion, attempting to engineer a sacrificial equilibrium within it.', 'We modern cultures no longer believe in anything but reality (which is, of course, the last of illusions), and have chosen to temper the ravages of illusion with that cultivated, docile form of the simulacrum that is aesthetic form.', 'There is a long history to this.', 'However, because it has a history, it also lasts only for a time, and it is perhaps now that we are seeing the disappearance of that history, of that restrained and conventional form of the simulacrum, and its replacement by the unconditional simulacrum, that is, a primal scene of illusion where we would meet up with all the inhuman phantasmagorias of all the cultures which preceded ours.', 'Warhol is the illustration of this unconditional simulacrum.', 'Warhol is a mutant.', 'At this stage of machination, of automachination, there is no longer any critical space, a space where subject and object are respectively present, but a paradoxical space, a space where subject and object have, respectively, disappeared.', 'Not unlike current science, where subject and object positions disappear simultaneously, the only reality of the object being that of its traces on a computer screen.', 'This new scientific space is itself a paradoxical space.', 'There is no more a real universe behind the screens which trace the trajectory of particles than there is a subject, Warhol, behind the image of Warhol.', 'Doubtless we no longer have art here; nor, perhaps, do we even precisely have science (what is a paradoxical science?).', 'But this paradoxical stage is the stage we are at, and it is irreversible.', 'We must, then, put the interminable polemic regarding the critical or noncritical value of Warhol behind us, the polemic about his complicity with the media or the capitalist system.', 'Certainly, there is no denunciation in the Warhol universe, since there is not even, strictly speaking, any enunciation.', 'That is his strength.', 'Any critical meaning would only weaken the paradoxical position.', 'Any negativity would merely detract from the image as extreme phenomenon, that is to say, the radical indifference of images to the world.', 'Therein lies the secret of the image, of its superficial radicality and its material innocence, this capacity to refract every interpretation into the void.', 'It is by preserving this indifference of images to the world and our own (Warholian) indifference to images that we preserve their virulence and their intensity.', 'Such is the objectless image, which lacks the imagination of the subject.', 'Like the famous knife without a blade which lacks a handle.', 'Instead of the handle being counterposed to the blade, as it is in the case of a real knife, in the ideal knife the absence of handle is counterposed to the absence of blade.', "Such is the perfection of the knife and such, too, is Warhol's universe, where nothing is opposed to nothing.", 'That no one is opposed to no one is also, in his own terms, the perfection of otherness, because it is insignificance which binds things together, which binds people together.', 'Warhol is agnostic, as we all are secretly.', 'The agnostic does not claim that God does not exist.', "He says: God exists (perhaps), but I don't believe in him.", "Warhol says: art exists (perhaps), but I don't believe in it.", "And it is precisely because I don't believe in it that I am the best.", 'This is neither pride nor the cynicism of advertising.', 'It is the logic of the agnostic.', 'Sexual fetishism, too, is sexually indifferent: it does not believe in sex, but only in the idea of sex which is, of course, asexual.', 'Thus we no longer believe in art, but only in the idea of art which has itself, of course, nothing aesthetic about it.', 'So Warhol can say: if I could be sure everything I do was just bluff, I would do extraordinary things.', "If I knew everything I did wasn't by me, I would do marvellous things.", 'That is snobbery, and at the same time it is the defiant challenge of the person who does not believe in the thing that he can do it better than all those who do.', 'Warhol never tires himself.', "The agnostic isn't going to tire himself out working for the glory of God, or to prove his existence.", "Warhol isn't going to tire himself out proving the existence of art.", 'Because, fundamentally, there is no need.', 'We no more need the pathos of art than we need the pathos of suffering or the pathos of desire.', 'A Stoic trait, this.', 'What is good about Warhol is that he is Stoical, agnostic, puritanical and heretical all at the same time.', 'Having all the qualities, he generously credits all around him with them.', "The world is there, and it's excellent.", "People are there, and they're OK.", "They have no need to believe in what they are doing, they're perfect.", "He is the best, but everyone's a genius.", 'Never before has the privilege of the creator been quashed in such a way, by a kind of maximalist irony.', 'And all without contempt or demagogy: there is in him a kind of airy innocence, a gracious form of the abolition of privileges.', 'There is in him something of the Cathars and the theory of the Perfect.', 'This Warholian munificence, so different from the sense of caste which is generally that of art and artists, does not derive from democratic principles.', 'It comes, rather, from a principle of illusion (the concept of the world as the work of the devil and, at the same time, that of perfection achieved here on earth are the two fundamental concepts of the Cathars.', 'They are also the two basic heresies in the eyes of the Church, as they are indeed today for all political and moral orthodoxies).', 'Illusion is, in effect, the most egalitarian, the most democratic principle there is: everyone is equal before the world as illusion, whereas we are not at all equal before the world as Truth and Reality, where all inequalities are engendered.', "This is why Warhol is able to make himself the scenarist of a perfect `walk-on', where all are equal.", 'All images are good, because they are all equally illusory.', 'Everyone is wonderful, and the snaps you take of them are inevitably successful.', 'This is the universal democracy of extras.', 'Warhol himself does merely this: a walk-on part.', 'Marilyn Monroe is a walk-on actor: she is a star only because she has entered pure walk-on.', 'When she fires at Warhol, Valerie Solanas is merely one extra shooting at another.', 'His assistants are extras, working for him, working in his stead.', 'Everyone -- and not just in the stage and media world, but in the political and moral world -- is doomed to walk-on parts.', 'What we have here is a metaphysical state of our modern world, which is akin to that of the unconditional simulacrum.', 'The difference is that, instead of having a depressed view of this, linked to our naturalistic prejudice, Warhol delights in this walk-on state, as though it were second nature to him.', 'A machine should be unhappy, because it is perfectly alienated.', 'But Warhol is not: he has invented the joy of the machine, the joy of making the world even more illusory than it was before.', 'For this is the fate of all our technologies: to render the world yet more illusory.', 'Warhol understood that.', "He understood that it is the machine which generates the total illusion of the modern world, and that it is by joyously espousing this machinic `walk-on' position [figuration] that he effects a kind of transfiguration, whereas art which takes itself for art merely looks like vulgar simulation.", "So far as fame is concerned, Warhol's position is very simple.", 'Fame is based on boredom, just as the aura of images is founded on their insignificance.', 'In his Journal, the meticulous management of his fame is accompanied by a remarkable indifference to his own life.', 'Fame is the accidental spotlight that lights up the involuntary actor of his own life.', 'It is the aura of an existence conceived as an exceptional fait divers, rendered exceptional by artificial light.', 'Everything is in the lighting.', 'The natural light of genius is rare, but the artificial light which reigns over our world is so plentiful that there will inevitably be enough for everyone.', 'Even a machine can become famous, and Warhol never aspired to anything but this machinic celebrity, a celebrity without consequence which leaves no trace.', 'A celebrity which comes from the demand of everything today to be approved and feted by the gaze.', 'It is said that he was self-advertising.', 'Not so: he was merely the medium for that gigantic advertising operation the world carries out through technology and images, forcing our imaginations to fade, our passions to turn outwards, shattering the mirror we held up to it (hypocritically, as it happens) to tap it for our profit.', 'This is why Warhol is not part of the history of art.', 'He is, quite simply, part of the world.', 'He does not represent it; he is a fragment of it: a fragment in the pure state.', 'This is why, seen from the viewpoint of art, he can be disappointing.', 'Seen as a refraction of our world, he is perfectly self-evident.', 'Like the world itself: looked at from the angle of meaning, the world is thoroughly disappointing.', 'From the angle of appearance and detail, it is perfectly self-evident.', 'And so is the Warhol machine, that extraordinary machine for filtering the world in its material self-evidence.', 'No one can claim to describe that machine.', 'That would imply a literal complicity, a machinic complicity, with Warhol.', 'Now, not everyone has the good fortune to be a machine.', "`I'll be your mirror': this is the formula of the subject.", '`We shall be your favourite disappearing act!', "': this is the

'The photo is not an image in real time.', 'It retains the moment of the negative, the suspense of the negative, that slight time-lag which allows the image to exist before the world -- or the object -- disappears into the image, which they could not do in the computer-generated image, where the real has already disappeared.', 'The photo preserves the moment of disappearance and thus the charm of the real, like that of a previous life.', 'The silence of photography.', 'One of its most precious qualities, unlike the cinema, TV or advertisements, on which you always have to impose a silence --

world.', 'Whatever the violence, speed or noise which surrounds it, it gives the object back its immobility and its silence.', 'In the greatest turbulence, it recreates the equivalent of the desert, of the stillness of phenomena.', 'It is the only way of moving through cities in silence, of moving through the world in silence.', 'Photography has an obsessional, narcissistic, ecstatic character.', 'It is a solitary activity.', 'The photographic image is irreparable, as irreparable as the state of things at a particular moment.', 'All retouching, all repentance, has, like all posing, an abominably aesthetic character.', 'The solitude of the photographic subject in space and time is correlative with the solitude of the object and its temperamental silence.', 'What photographs well is

itself, more subtle), but for the person who does not lack me, for what is perfectly capable of existing without me.', 'Someone who does not lack me -- that is radical otherness.', 'Desire is always the desire for that alien perfection, at the same time as it is the desire perhaps to shatter it, to break it down.', 'You get aroused only for things whose perfection and impunity you want both to share and to shatter.', 'Where does the objective magic of photography come from?', 'The answer is that it is the object which does all the work.', 'Photographers will never admit it, and always argue that all the originality lies in their vision of the world.', 'This is how they take photos which are too good, confusing their subjective vision with the reflex miracle of the photographic act.', 'This has nothing to do with writing, the seductive power of which is far superior.', "But photography's power to stupefy is far greater than that of writing.", 'It is rare for a text to be able to offer itself up with the same instantaneity, the same manifestness as a shadow, a light, a texture, a photographic detail.', 'Just sometimes in Gombrowicz or in Nabokov, when their writing recaptures the trace of the original disorder, the material, objectal vehemence of things without qualities, the erotic potency of a senseless world.', 'Hence the difficulty of photographing individuals and faces.', "It is impossible to get someone into focus photographically when you can't properly get them `into focus' psychologically.", 'Subjects, unlike objects, are never willing accessories.', 'They make the lens tremble.', 'Within any human being whatever, there is such a drama going on, such a complex (de-)construction, that the lens -- tempted, in spite of itself, by resemblance -- strips it of its character.', 'The problem does not arise with objects which, not having passed through the mirror stage, are exempt from all resemblance.', 'They say there is always a photographic moment to be seized where the most banal of beings yield up their secret identity.', 'But what is interesting is their secret alterity, and rather than looking for the identity beneath the appearances, we should look for the mask beneath the identity, the figure which haunts us and diverts us from our identities -- the masked divinity which, in effect, haunts each of us for a moment, one day or another.', 'For objects, savages, animals, primitives, otherness is sure, singularity is sure.', "The least significant of objects is `other'.", 'For the subject, it is much less sure.', 'Because the subject -- is this the price he pays for his intelligence or the sign of his stupidity?', '-- succeeds, by dint of often incredible efforts, in existing only within the limits of his identity.', 'If we can have any hope of staving off this process, it is by making people a little more enigmatic to themselves, a little more alien one to another.', 'Thus, in the photographic act, it is not a question of taking them for objects but of making them become objects, and hence making them become other -- that is, of taking them for what they are.', 'If there is a secret to illusion, it involves taking the world

than nothing, and aspires to being founded on the guarantee of an objective and decipherable world, radical thought, for its part, wagers on the illusion of the world.', 'It aspires to the status of illusion, restoring the non-veracity of facts, the non-signification of the world, proposing the opposite hypothesis that there is nothing rather than something, and going in pursuit of that nothing which runs beneath the apparent continuity of meaning.', 'The radical prediction is always the prediction of the non-reality of facts, of the illusoriness of the state of fact.', 'It begins only with the presentiment of that illusoriness, and is never confused with the objective state of things.', 'Every confusion of that kind is of the order of the confusion of the messenger and the message,

themselves, which are never anything but what they are [ne sont jamais que ce qu'ils sont].", "That is to say, they are never more than what they are and they are, literally, never only what they are

to extract from it an improbable truth, not to adapt to the facts in order to abstract some logical construction from them, but to set in place a form, a matrix of illusion and disillusion, which seduced reality will spontaneously feed and which will, consequently, be verified remorselessly (the only need is to shift the camera angle from time to time).', 'For reality asks nothing other than to submit itself to hypotheses.', 'And it confirms them all.', 'That, indeed, is its ruse and its vengeance.', 'The theoretical ideal would be to set in place propositions in such a way that they could be disconfirmed by reality, in such a way that reality could only oppose them violently, and thereby unmask itself.', 'For reality is an illusion, and all thought must seek first of all to unmask it.', 'To do that, it must itself advance behind a mask and constitute itself as a decoy, without regard for its own truth.', 'It must pride itself on not being an instrument of analysis, not being a critical tool.', 'For it is the world which must analyse itself.', 'It is the world itself which must reveal itself not as truth, but as illusion.', 'The derealization of the world will be the work of the world itself.', 'Reality must be caught in the trap, we must move quicker than reality.', 'Ideas, too, have to move faster than their shadows.', 'But if they go too quickly, they lose even their shadows.', 'No longer having even the shadow of an idea...', 'Words move quicker than meaning, but if they go too quickly, we have madness: the ellipsis of meaning can make us lose even the

its partisans: by throwing them back on their own desire.', 'In the end, it is perhaps more a sphinx than a bitch.', 'More subtly, it wreaks vengeance on those who deny it by paradoxically proving them right.', 'When the most cynical, most provocative hypothesis is verified, the trick really is a low one; you are disarmed by the lamentable confirmation of your words by an unscrupulous reality.', 'So, for example, you put forward the idea of simulacrum, without really believing in it, even hoping that the real will refute it (the guarantee of scientificity for Popper).', 'Alas, only the fanatical supporters of reality react; reality, for its part, does not seem to wish to prove you wrong.', 'Quite to the contrary, every kind of simulacrum parades around in it.', 'And reality, filching the idea, henceforth adorns itself with all the rhetoric of simulation.', "It is the simulacrum which ensures the continuity of the real today, the simulacrum which now conceals not the truth, but the fact that there isn't any -- that is to say, the continuity of the nothing.", 'Such is the paradox of all thought which disputes the validity of the real: when it sees itself robbed of its own concept.', 'Events, bereft of meaning in themselves, steal meaning from us.', 'They adapt to the most fantastical hypotheses, just as natural species and viruses adapt to the most hostile environments.', 'They have an extraordinary mimetic capacity: no longer is it theories which adapt to events, but the reverse.', 'And, in so doing, they mystify us, for a theory which is verified is no longer a theory.', "It's terrifying to see the idea coincide with the reality.", 'These are the death-throes of the concept.', 'The epiphany of the real is the twilight of its concept.', 'We have lost that lead which ideas had over the world, that distance which meant that an idea remained an idea.', 'Thought has to be exceptional, anticipatory and at the margin -- has to be the projected shadow of future events.', 'Today, we are lagging behind events.', 'They may sometimes give the impression of receding; in fact, they passed us long ago.', 'The simulated disorder of things has moved faster than we have.', 'The reality effect has succumbed to acceleration -- anamorphosis of speed.', 'Events, in their being, are never behind themselves, are always out ahead of their meaning.',

over to the craziest hypotheses?', 'When everything conforms, beyond even our wildest hopes, to the ironic, critical, alternative, catastrophic model?', 'Well, that is paradise: we are beyond the Last Judgement, in immortality.', 'The only problem is to survive there.', 'For there the irony, the challenging, the anticipation, the maleficence come to an end, as inexorably as hope dies at the gates of hell.', 'And it is indeed there that hell begins, the hell of the unconditional realization of all ideas, the hell of the real.', 'You can see why, as Adorno says, concepts prefer to scupper themselves rather than reach that point.', 'Something else has been stolen from us: indifference.', 'The power of indifference, which is the quality of the mind, as opposed to the play of differences, which is the characteristic of the world.', 'Now, this has been stolen from us by a world grown indifferent, as the extravagance of thought has been stolen from us by an extravagant world.', 'When things, events, refer one to another and to their undifferentiated concept, then the equivalence of the world meets and cancels out the indifference of thought -- and we have boredom.', 'No more altercations; nothing at stake.', 'It is the parting of the dead sea.', 'How fine indifference was in a world that was not indifferent -- in a different, convulsive, contradictory world, a world with issues and passions!', 'That being the case, indifference immediately became an issue and a passion itself.', 'It could preempt the indifference of the world, and turn that pre-emption into an event.', 'Today, it is difficult to be more indifferent to their reality than the facts themselves, more indifferent to their meaning than images.', 'Our operational world is an apathetic world.',

guilty, and every idea that cannot defend itself deserves to disappear.', 'On the other hand, one must fight all charges of irresponsibility, nihilism or despair.', 'Radical thought is never depressive.', 'On this point, there is total misunderstanding.', 'Ideological and moralistic critique, obsessed with meaning and content, obsessed with the political finality of discourse, never takes into account writing, the act of writing, the poetic, ironic, allusive force of language, of the juggling with meaning.', 'It does not see that the resolution of meaning is to be found there -- in the form itself, the formal materiality of expression.', 'Meaning, for its part, is always unhappy.', 'Analysis is, by definition, unhappy, since it is born of critical disillusionment.', 'But language, for its part, is happy, even when referring to a world without illusion and without hope.', 'That might even be the definition of a radical thinking: a happy form and an intelligence without hope.', 'Critics, being unhappy by nature, always choose ideas as their battleground.', 'They do not see that if discourse always tends to produce meaning, language and writing, for their part, always create illusion -- they are the living illusion of meaning, the resolution of the infelicity of meaning by the felicity of language.', 'And this is surely the only political -- or transpolitical -- act that can be accomplished by the person who writes.', 'As for ideas, everyone has them.', 'More than they need.', 'What counts is the poetic singularity of the analysis.', 'That alone can justify writing,

infelicitous language that is maddeningly tedious and demoralizingly platitudinous, as is most often the case.', 'The absolute tediousness secreted by that idealistic, voluntaristic thought is the secret sign of its despair -- as regards both the world and its own discourse.', 'That is where true depressive thought is to be found, among those who speak only of the transcending and transforming of the world, when they are incapable of transfiguring their own language.', 'Radical thought is a stranger to all resolving of the world in the direction of an objective reality and its deciphering.', 'It does not decipher.', 'It anagrammatizes, it disperses concepts and ideas and, by its reversible sequencing, takes account both of meaning and of the fundamental illusoriness of meaning.', 'Language takes account of the very illusion of language as definitive stratagem and, through it, of the illusion of the world as infinite trap, as seduction of the mind, as spiriting away of all our mental faculties.', 'While it is a vehicle of meaning, it is at the same time a superconductor of illusion and non-meaning.', 'Language is merely the involuntary accomplice of communication -- by its very form it appeals to the spiritual and material imagination of sounds and rhythm, to the dispersal of meaning in the event of language.', 'This passion for artifice, for illusion, is the passion for undoing that too-beauteous constellation of meaning.', 'And for letting the imposture of the world show through, which is its enigmatic function, and the mystification of the world, which is its secret.', 'While at the same time letting its own imposture show through -- the impostor, not the composteur [composing stick] of meaning.', 'This passion has the upper hand in the free and witty use of language, in the witty play of writing.', 'Where that artifice is not taken into account, not only is its charm lost, but the meaning itself cannot be resolved.', 'Cipher, do not

the prohibition of thought by the dominant clerisy.', 'Every intervention by critical, enlightened and right-thinking intellectuals, all of them politically correct even when they do not know it, will

years later.', 'By an amazing coincidence, it begins in Haiti and spreads throughout the world and, by another paradoxical coincidence, it is eventually discovered that this illness, which science is powerless to control (exactly as with AIDS), originated in a plot hatched by homosexuals to exterminate the female of the species!', 'The epidemic runs its course, all adolescent girls and young women disappear, and the human race is soon threatened with extinction.', 'The rest of the book, full of dramatic twists and turns, carries on rather like a thriller.', 'But the central idea is that of an extermination of femaleness -- a terrifying allegory of the extermination of all otherness, for which the feminine is the metaphor and, perhaps, more than the metaphor.', 'What we ourselves have fallen victim to -- and by no means allegorically -- is a virus destructive of otherness.', 'And we may predict that -- even more than in the case of AIDS -- no science will be able to protect us from this viral pathology which, by dint of antibodies and immune strategies, aims at the extinction, pure and simple, of the other.', 'Though, for the moment, this virus does not affect the biological reproduction of the species, it affects an even more fundamental function, that of the symbolic reproduction of the other, favouring, rather, a cloned, asexual reproduction of the species-less individual.', 'For to be deprived of the other is to be deprived of sex, and to be deprived of sex is to be deprived of symbolic belonging to any species whatsoever.', 'On its appearance in Italy (in 1953 -- it was left unpublished for twenty years, as no publisher would take it) the book was condemned and withdrawn from circulation on grounds of obscenity, though in point of fact there is nothing less pornographic than a world without women.', 'But that was merely an alibi to conceal, under cover of a destruction of femaleness, the panic idea of a yet more monstrous destruction -- the idea of a world given over entirely to the selfsame [le Même].', 'This is the literal end of alienation.', 'There is no one on the other side any more.', 'In the past we would have seen this as the ideal goal of the subject -- total appropriation of and control over oneself.', 'Today we can see that alienation protected us from something worse: from the definitive loss of the other, from the expropriation of the other by the same.', 'In German, there are two apparently synonymous terms with a very significant distinction between them.', "`Verfremdung' means becoming other, becoming estranged from oneself -- alienation in the literal sense.", "`Entfremdung', by contrast, means to be dispossessed of the other, to lose all otherness.", 'Now, it is much more serious to be dispossessed of the other than of oneself.', 'Being deprived of the other is worse than alienation: a lethal change, by liquidation of the dialectical opposition itself.', 'An irrevocable destabilization, that of the subject without object, of the same without other -- definitive stasis and metastasis of the Same.', 'A tragic destiny for individuals and for our -- self-programming and self-referential -- systems: no more adversaries, no more hostile environments -- no environment at all any longer, no more exteriority.', 'This is like wresting a species away from its natural predators.', "No longer threatened by them, it cannot but destroy itself (by `depredation', as it were).", "Death being the great natural predator, a species we attempt at all costs to immortalize and wrest away from death -- as we do with all our replacement technologies for the body's organs -- is doomed to disappear.", "The best strategy for bringing about someone's ruin is to eliminate everything which threatens him, thus causing him to lose all his defences, and it is this strategy we are applying to ourselves.", 'By eliminating the other in all its forms (illness, death, negativity, violence, strangeness), not to mention racial and linguistic differences, by eliminating all singularities in order to radiate total positivity, we are eliminating ourselves.', 'We have fought negativity and death, rooting out evil in all its forms.', 'By eliminating the work of the negative, we have unleashed positivity, and that is what has become lethal today.', 'By setting off the chain reaction of the positive, we have at the same time -- by a perverse, but perfectly coherent effect -- released an intense viral pathology.', 'For a virus, far from being negative, is the product, rather, of an ultrapositivity of which it is the lethal embodiment.', 'This had escaped us, as had the metamorphoses of evil which follow the advances of reason about like a shadow.', 'This paradigm of the subject without object, of the subject without other, can be seen in all that has lost its shadow and become transparent to itself.', 'Even in devitalized substances: in sugar without calories, salt without sodium, life without spice,

slave?', 'He ends up terrorizing himself.', 'And of a slave without a master?', 'He ends up exploiting himself.', 'The two are conjoined today in the modern form of voluntary servitude: enslavement to data systems and calculation systems -- total efficiency, total performance.', 'We have become masters -- at least virtual masters -- of this world, but the object of that mastery, the finality of that mastery, have disappeared.', 'The Surgical Removal of Otherness This liquidation of the Other is accompanied by an artificial synthesis of otherness -- a radical cosmetic surgery of which cosmetic surgery on faces and bodies is merely a symptom.', 'For the crime is perfect only when even the traces of the destruction of the Other have disappeared.', 'With modernity, we enter the age of the production of the other.', 'The aim is no longer to kill the other, devour it, seduce it, vie with it, love it or hate it, but, first, to produce it.', 'It is no longer an object of passion, it is an object of production.', 'Perhaps, in its irreducible singularity, the Other has become dangerous or unbearable, and its seduction has to be exorcized?', 'Perhaps, quite simply, otherness and the dual relation progressively disappear with the rise of individual values?', 'The fact remains that otherness does come to be in short supply and, for want of living otherness as destiny, the Other has to be produced imperatively as difference.', 'This also goes for the body, sex and social relations.', 'It is to escape the world as destiny, the body as destiny, sex (and the opposite sex) as destiny, that the production of the Other as difference is invented.', 'It is the same with sexual difference.', 'To wish to disentangle the inextricable otherness of male and female, to restore each to its specificity and difference, is an absurdity.', 'Yet this is the absurdity of our sexual culture of liberation and emancipation of desire.', 'Each sex with its anatomical and psychological characteristics, with its own desire and all the irresolvable dramas that ensue, including the ideology of sex and the utopia of a difference based both in right and in nature.', 'This invention of difference coincides with the invention of a new image of woman, and thus a change of sexual paradigm.', 'That change, on the threshold of modernity, at the turn of the nineteenth century, was the production by male hysteria of an imagining of woman in place of her stolen femininity (Christina von Braun, Nicht-Ich, 1985; and Die schamlose Schönheit des Vergangenen, 1989).', 'In this hysterical configuration, it was to some extent the femininity of man which was projected into woman, shaping her as ideal figure in his likeness.', 'The point was no longer, as in the courtly and aristocratic figure of seduction, to conquer woman, to seduce or be seduced by her, but to produce her as realized utopia -- ideal woman or femme fatale, a hysterical and supernatural metaphor.', 'The staging of this ideal was the work of Romantic Eros: woman as projective resurrection of the selfsame, a twin-like, almost incestuous figure -- an artefact doomed from that point on to amorous confusion, that is, to a pathos of the ideal resemblance between beings and sexes.', 'The sexual difference, the concept of sexual difference which was established in the same movement, was merely a variant of the incestuous form.', 'In that concept, man and woman were no longer anything but the mirroring [mirage] of each other.', 'They were separated and different only the better to become the -- often indifferent -- mirrors of each other.', 'The whole machinery of eroticism was turned on its head, since the erotic attraction which formerly emanated from strangeness and otherness now shifted over to emanate from similarity and likeness.', "So Martini's Il Mondo senza Donne is not as allegorical as all that.", 'By the invention of a femaleness which makes woman superfluous, makes her a supplemental incarnation, woman really has disappeared -- if not physically, then at least beneath a substitute femininity.', 'Moreover, this goes for man too, since it is his own stolen femininity that he transposes into the theatrical mirror of the role and idea of woman.', 'And if the real woman seems to disappear in this hysterical invention, we have to see that male desire also becomes entirely problematic, since it is now capable only of projecting itself into its image, and thus becoming purely speculative.', 'All the endless commentaries on the sexual privilege of the masculine gender are thus mere foolishness.', "There is, in the sexual illusion of our time, a kind of immanent justice which means that, in this trompe-l'oeil difference, both sexes lose their singularity equally, their difference culminating inexorably in non-differentiation.", 'The process of extrapolation of the Selfsame and twinning of the sexes (if twinhood is such a topical theme, this is because it reflects this mode of libidinal cloning) results in a progressive assimilation which goes so far as to render sexuality a useless function.', 'Here anticipating the clones of the future, who will be sexed to no purpose, since sexuality will no longer be needed for their reproduction.', 'The coming of the problematic of gender, now taking over from that of sex, illustrates this progressive dilution of the sexual function.', 'This is the era of the Transsexual, where the conflicts linked to difference -- and even the biological and anatomical signs of difference -- survive long after the real otherness of the sexes has disappeared.', "When the sexes eye each other up, squint out through each other's eyes.", 'The male eyes up the female, the female eyes up the male.', 'This is no longer the seductive gaze but a generalized sexual strabismus, reflecting that of moral and cultural values: the true eyes up the false, the beautiful eyes up the ugly, good eyes up evil, and vice versa.', "They each `lock on to' the other in an attempt to misappropriate its distinctive signs.", 'But both are in fact in league to short-circuit difference.', 'They function like communicating vessels, according to the new machinic rituals of switching or commutation.', 'The utopia of sexual difference ends in the switching of sexual poles, and in interactive exchange.', 'Instead of a dual relation, sex becomes a reversible function.', 'In place of alterity, an alternating current.', 'It is in seduction, in illusion, in artifice that there is the maximum intensity, that each sex is fatal for the other, that is, the bearer of a radical otherness.', "In naturalistic terms, by contrast -- the terms on which our difference and, consequently, our `liberation' are based -- the sexes are less different than is commonly thought.", 'They tend, rather, to merge, or even to change places.', "What is `liberated' is precisely not their singularity but their relative conflation and, of course, once the orgy and the ecstasy of desire are over, their respective indifference.", 'Where do we find talk of passion now?', 'It would seem that we talk, rather, of sexual compassion.', "We don't even hear much talk of desire.", 'That rapidly declined in the firmament of concepts.', 'It has become the astral theme of a stereotyped jargon of psychoanalysis and advertising.', 'Liberation is always naturalistic: it naturalizes desire as function, as energy, as libido.', "And that naturalization of pleasures and differences leads just as `naturally' to the loss of the sexual illusion.", "Sex removed from artifice, illusion and seduction, and restored to its conscious or unconscious economy (you would have to be very clever indeed to say whether this was the `reality' of sex).", "Woman wrested from her artificial condition and restored to her natural being, her `legitimate' status as sexual being and, at the same time, to formal recognition.", 'Now, seduction and passion care nothing for the recognition of the other.', "And singularity has nothing to do with identity or difference -- its mode of action is singular and illegal, and that's all there is to it.", 'Recognition goes with difference, and both are bourgeois virtues.', 'In any case, in this whole business about difference, there is always one term more different than the other.', 'Woman is, in fact, more different than man.', 'And not only more different than him, but more than different.', 'Man is only different, but woman is other: strange, absent, enigmatic, antagonistic.', 'And it was to conjure away this radical otherness that biological difference, and also psychological, ideological and political difference, and so on, were invented.', 'These things can all be worked out in terms of an ordered opposition, albeit one conceived in terms of relations of force.', 'But, strictly speaking, the opposition does not exist.', 'It is merely the substitution of a symmetrical, differential form for a dual, dissymmetrical one.', "In other words, this form of `natural' compromise is as fragile as can be.", 'You cannot trust nature.', 'The femme fatale is never fatale as a natural element, but as artifice, as seductress or as the projective artefact of male hysteria.', 'The absent woman, ideal or diabolic, but always fetishized, that constructed woman, that machinic Eve, that mental object, scoffs at the difference of the sexes.', 'She scoffs at desire and the subject of desire.', 'More feminine than the feminine: the woman-object.', 'Yet we are not dealing with alienation here but with a mental object, a pure object (which does not take itself for a subject), a being which is unreal, fake, cerebral, a devourer of grey and libidinal matter.', 'Through her, it is sex which denies sexual difference, it is desire itself which lays a trap for itself, the object which takes its revenge.', 'The woman-object, the femme fatale, plays on that hysterical femininity which is masculine in essence.', 'She plays on that speculative image by an unconditional speculation, by an inflation of her own image.', "By overbidding her condition as object, she becomes `fatal' for herself, and this is how she becomes so for others.", "In the very features of the artificial ideal which has been manufactured for her, it is the feminine which shows through -- not to meet up again with the `real' woman she is supposed to be, but to distance her yet further from her nature, and make of that artifice a triumphant destiny.", 'But the sexes have asymmetrical destinies.', "It is not possible for man to take this same `double or quits' option with the ideal type of virility imposed on him.", 'He cannot raise his bid, but only let go of some of his cards.', "And if there are fewer and fewer femmes fatales, this is because there aren't even any men for them to prey on.", "This respective hystericization of roles is, in any case, diminishing as belief in nature fades in the contemporary period and as, with its `liberation', the problematic and ambiguous character of this difference becomes glaringly obvious.", "Hysteria was sexuality's last form of fatal strategy.", 'It is not by chance, then, that it is disappearing today, after fomenting all the extreme figures of the sexual mythology of a whole century.', 'Fatal strategies step aside before the final solution.', 'A new spectrum of dispersion has appeared and, in this low-definition sexual game, it does indeed seem that we are sliding from ecstasy to metastasis, the metastasis of countless little dispositifs of libidinal transfusion and perfusion -- micro-scenarios of unsexuality and transsexuality in all its forms.', 'Resolution of sex into its disjecta membra, its part-objects, its fractal elements.', 'The only alternative, in these new sexual conditions of indifference, would seem to lie with woman.', 'Because she herself wishes to produce herself as different, because she no longer wishes to be produced as such by male hysteria, it is incumbent upon her to produce the other in return, to produce a new figure of the other as object of seduction, as the male succeeded in doing to some extent in producing a culture of the seductive image of woman.', 'We havehere the problem of a woman, having once become a subject of desire, no longer finding the other she could desire as such (part of the more general problem of our age of achieving subjecthood in a world in which, in the interim, the object has disappeared).', 'For the secret never lies in the equivalent exchange of desires, under the sign of egalitarian difference; it lies in inventing the other who will be able to play on -- and make sport of -- my own desire, defer it, suspend it, and thus arouse it indefinitely.', 'Is the female gender capable today of producing -- since it no longer wishes to personify it -- this same seductive otherness?', 'Is the female gender still hysterical enough to invent the other?', 'It seems, unfortunately, that we are coming close to the opposite extreme -- that is to say, to the exacerbated form of difference or, in other words, the final solution: sexual harassment.', 'The ultimate development of female hysteria -- pornography being the ultimate and caricatural development of male hysteria.', 'These are, basically, the two sides of the same hysterical indifference.', 'Sexual harassment: phobic caricature of every sexual approach, unconditional refusal to seduce and be seduced.', 'Is this compulsion merely the alibi of indifference or does it, like all allergic symptoms, conceal a hypersensitivity to the other?', 'The fact remains that the slightest hint of seduction, any expression of desire, is met by a charge of rape.', 'There would be a presumption of rape at every stage in the relationship, even a conjugal relationship, if it is not expressly consented to.', 'Italian law regards inducement as an offence -- that is to say, not forcing oneself on the other to provoke their desire, nor even to seduce them, but the mere fact of inducing their consent by some gesture or sign or other.', 'If we are to take this attitude, we should put the sperm on the blacklist too, since its effort to penetrate the ovum is surely the prototype of sexual harassment (though perhaps there is inducement on the part of the ovary?).', 'Where does rape begin, where does sexual harassment begin?', 'Once we have marked out the demarcation line of an unassailable difference between the sexes, there is no longer any possibility of their coming together except in violence.', "So, in Bellochio's film The Sentence [La Condanna], the question is whether the man really raped the woman, since she had an orgasm.", "The prosecution claims that he did, while the defence's plea is that, in the end, the victim consented.", "But no one asks whether the orgasm wasn't an aggravating circumstance.", 'One may in fact argue that forcing the other to have pleasure, to feel rapture, is indeed the height of rape, and more serious than forcing the other to give you pleasure.', 'At any rate, this brings out the absurdity of this entire problematic.', "Sexual harassment marks the arrival on the scene of an impotent, victim's sexuality, a sexuality impotent to constitute itself either as object or as subject of desire in its paranoid wish for identity and difference.", "It is no longer decency that is threatened with violation, but sex or, rather, sexist idiocy, which `takes the law into its own hands'.", 'At the same time, this illustrates the dead-end of difference.', 'The problem of difference is insoluble, for the simple reason that the terms involved are not different but incomparable.', 'The terms we are used to setting in opposition to each other are quite simply incompatible, which means that the concept of difference has no meaning.', 'Thus, Female and Male are two incomparable terms, and if there is, deep down, no sexual difference, this is because the two sexes are not opposable.', 'This goes for all the traditional oppositions.', 'We can say the same of Good and Evil.', 'They are not on the same plane, and it is an illusion to oppose them.', 'The real problem [le mal] is precisely the strangeness, the imperviousness of Good and Evil [le Mal] to each other, which means there is no reconciling, no superseding them, and thus no ethical solution to the problem of their opposition.', 'The inexorable otherness of Evil passes across the ecliptic of morality.', 'The same goes for freedom in its grapplings with information -- the leitmotiv of our media ethics: this is a false conflict, because there is no real confrontation, since the two terms are not on the same plane.', 'There is no ethics of information.', 'What defines otherness is not that the two terms are not identifiable, but that they are not opposable.', 'Otherness is of the order of the incomparable.', 'It is not exchangeable in terms of a general equivalence; it is not negotiable; and yet it circulates in the mode of complicity and the dual relation, both in seduction and in war.', 'It is not even opposed to identity: it plays with it, just as illusion is not opposed to the real, but plays with it, and as the simulacrum is not opposed to truth, but plays with truth -- doing so, therefore, beyond true and false, beyond difference -- and just as the feminine is not opposed to the masculine, but plays with the masculine, somewhere beyond sexual difference.', 'The two terms do not correlate: the second always plays with the first.', 'The latter is always a more subtle reality which enwraps the former in the sign of its disappearance.', 'The whole effort will be to reduce this antagonistic principle, this incompatibility, to a mere difference, to a well-tempered play of opposition, to a negotiation of identity and difference in place of the stolen otherness.', 'All that seeks to be singular and incomparable, and does not enter into the play of difference, must be exterminated.', 'Either physically or by integration into the differential game where all singularities vanish into the universal field.', 'So it is with primitive cultures, for example: their myths have become comparable under the aegis of structural analysis.', 'Their signs have become exchangeable under the umbrella of a universal culture, in exchange for their right to difference.', 'Whether denied by racism or neutralized by differential culturalism, those cultures were faced, at any event, with a final solution.', 'This reconciliation of all antagonistic forms in the name of consensus and conviviality is the worst thing we can do.', 'We must reconcile nothing.', 'We must keep open the otherness of forms, the disparity between terms; we must keep alive the forms of the irreducible.', "The `Laying-Off' of Desire In facial features, sex, illnesses and death, identity is perpetually changing.", "This is the body as destiny, which has to be exorcized at all costs -- through the appropriation of the body as projection of self, the individual appropriation of desire, of one's appearance, one's image: cosmetic surgery on all fronts.", 'If the body is no longer a site of otherness but of identification, then we have urgently to become reconciled with it, repair it, perfect it, turn it into an ideal object.', 'Everyone treats their bodies the way men treat women in projective identification: they invest them as a fetish, making an autistic cult of them, subjecting them to a quasi-incestuous manipulation.', "And it is the body's resemblance to its model which becomes a source of eroticism and £white' seduction -- in the sense that it effects a kind of white magic of identity, as opposed to the black magic of otherness.", 'This is how it is with body-building: you get into your body as you would into a suit of nerve and muscle.', 'The body is not muscular, but muscled.', 'It is the same with the brain and with social relations or exchanges: body-building, brainstorming, word-processing.', 'Madonna is the ideal specimen of this, our muscled Immaculate Conception, our muscular angel who delivers us from the weaknesses of the body (pity the poor shade of Marilyn!).', 'The sheath of muscles is the equivalent of character armour.', 'In the past, women merely wrapped themselves in their image and their finery -- Freud speaks of those people who live with a kind of inner mirror, in a fleshly, happy self-reference.', 'That narcissistic ideal is past and gone; body-building has

own, which functions by surface impulse, produces this kind of surface repulsion, which is its bodily manifestation.', 'Every society which functions by rejection, by exclusion, causes this kind of inflammation or protective rash -- a barrage against the seduction of a world you fear, but also against the crowding-in of a world which disgusts you.', 'Contrary to the hysteric, who, by making an exhibition of himself, betrays his despair at not being there, allergy testifies to the confusion of being there, and to the excessive presence of the body.', 'Let us not forget that allergy is hypersensitivity to a particular substance.', 'It is an excess of positive reaction.', 'Thus an allergic world is a world of excess, of an oversensitivity to anything whatever -- precisely, to others?', '-- but one which turns around in a negative conversion.', 'The same pattern in anorexia: denial of the excess of body, metaphor for the hypertrophy of the system.', 'All these indifferent passions, or passions born of indifference, all these negative passions, culminate in hatred.', "A strange expression: `I've got the hate' [J'ai la haine].", 'No object.', "It is like `I'm demonstrating', but for whom, for what?", "`I take responsibility' [J'assume], but for what?", 'Nothing in particular.', 'One perhaps takes responsibility precisely for the nothing.', 'One demonstrates for or against the nothing -- how are we to know?', 'This is the fate of all these intransitive verbs.', "The graffiti said: `I exist', `I live at this particular place'.", "This was stated with a kind of exultation, yet at the same time it said: `There is no meaning to my life'.", "Similarly, `I've got the hate' says at the same time: `This hate I have has no object'; `There's no meaning to it'.", 'Hatred is doubtless something which does indeed outlive any definable object, and feeds on the disappearance of that object.', 'Who are we to take against today?', 'There, precisely, is the object: the absent other of hatred.', "`Having' hatred is like a sort of potential of -- negative and reactive -- energy, but energy all the same.", 'These are, indeed, the only passions we have today: hatred, disgust, allergy, aversion, rejection and disaffection.', "We no longer know what we want, but we know what we don't want.", 'In its pure expression of rejection, it is a non-negotiable, irremediable passion.', 'Yet there is in it something like an invitation to the absent other to offer himself as an object for that hatred.', 'The dream of hatred is to give rise to a heartfelt enmity, which is scarcely available at all in our world now, as all conflicts are immediately contained.', 'Over against the hatred born of rivalry and conflict there is a hatred born of accumulated indifference which can suddenly crystallize in an extreme physical outburst.', 'We are not speaking of class hatred now, which, paradoxically, remained a bourgeois passion.', 'That had a target, and was the driving force behind historical action.', "This hatred is externalized only in episodes of `acting-out'.", 'It does not give rise to historical violence, but to a virulence born of disaffection with politics and history.', 'In this sense, it is the characteristic passion not of the end of history but of a history without end, a history which is a dead-end, since there has been no resolution of all the problems it posed.', 'It is possible that beyond the end, in those reaches where things turn around, there is room for an indeterminate passion, where what remains of energy also turns around, like time, into a negative passion.', 'A negative passion cannot become universal.', 'You cannot imagine a federation of hatreds.', 'You might almost wish to see such a scenario come about.', "But the worst situation doesn't always materialize.", 'The fact remains that from this point on there is something which is completely beyond social regulation.', 'If this is not the end of History, it is certainly the end of the social.', 'We are no longer in anomie, but in anomaly.', 'Anomaly is what escapes not only the law but the rule.', "What is outside the game, `offside', no longer in a position to play.", 'The outlaw space bred violence; this offside space breeds virulence.', 'But as to what exactly is being bred in anomaly, we have no notion.', 'When a system becomes universal (the media, networks, the financial markets, human rights), it automatically becomes anomalous and secretes virulences of all kinds: financial crashes, AIDS, computer viruses, deregulation, disinformation.', 'Hatred itself is a virus of this kind.', 'Take Paulin, the man from Guadeloupe who went around murdering old ladies a few years ago.', 'A monstrous individual, but cool, and with no apparent hatred in him.', 'He had no identity, and was of indeterminate sex and mixed race.', 'He committed his murders without violence or bloodshed.', 'And he recounted them with an odd detachment.', 'Being indifferent to himself, he was eliminating people who were themselves indifferent.', 'But we can assume that behind all this there was a deep fund of radical hatred.', "Doubtless Paulin `had the hate', but he was too classy, too educated, to express it openly.", 'In the consensual universal order (the New World Order, the New Democratic Order) violent singularities well up, reflecting the extent of the inadmissibility of that order.', "The principle of negotiation and reconciliation at any price is a principle implying a final solution, which sometimes leads to `the' final solution.", 'We do not need psychoanalysis to tell us that man is an ambiguous, untameable animal, and that it is senseless to attempt to extirpate evil from him in order to turn him into a rational being.', 'Yet it is upon this absurdity that all our progressive ideologies are based.', 'In the process, a residue is left over which is not dealt with because it cannot be, and naturally this becomes transformed into hatred.', 'In this sense, hatred, a viral passion, is also a vital passion.', 'Against the perfection of the system, hatred is a last vital reaction.', 'It is the same sentiment which, in all non-- Western peoples, fuels that deep, visceral denial of what we represent and what we are.', "As though those peoples also `had the hate'.", 'We can lavish on them all the universal charity we are capable of, but there is about them a kind of otherness which will not be understood, a kind of incompatibility which will not be bargained away.', 'The gulf between our culture of the universal and what remains of singularities is growing firmer and deeper.', 'Their ressentiment may be impotent, but from the depths of their virtual extermination a passion for revenge is infiltrating and dislocating the Western world, just as the ghost of the excluded is beginning to haunt our conventional societies.', 'The Revenge of the Mirror People Here begins the great revenge of otherness, of all the forms which, subtly or violently deprived of their singularity, henceforth pose an insoluble problem for the social order, and also for the political and biological orders.', 'In those days the world of mirrors and the world of men were not, as they are now, cut off from each other.', 'They were, besides, quite different; neither beings nor colours nor shapes were the same.', 'Both kingdoms, the specular and the human, lived in harmony; you could come and go through mirrors.', 'One night the mirror people invaded the earth.', 'Their power was great, but at the end of bloody warfare the magic arts of the Yellow Emperor prevailed.', 'He repulsed the invaders, imprisoned them in their mirrors, and forced on them the task of repeating, as though in a kind of dream, all the actions of men.', 'He stripped them of their power and of their forms, and reduced them to mere slavish reflections.', 'Nonetheless, a day will come when the magic spell will be shaken off... shapes will begin to stir.', 'Little by little they will differ from us; little by little they will not imitate us.', 'They will break through the barriers of glass or metal and this time will not be defeated.', 'J. L. Borges Such is the allegory of otherness vanquished and condemned to the servile fate of resemblance.', 'Our image in the mirror is not innocent, then.', 'Behind every reflection, every resemblance, every representation, a defeated enemy lies concealed.', 'The Other vanquished, and condemned merely to be the Same.', "This casts a singular light on the problem of representation and of all those mirrors which reflect us `spontaneously' with an objective indulgence.", 'None of that is true, and every representation is a servile image, the ghost of a once sovereign being whose singularity has been obliterated.', 'But a being which will one day rebel, and then our whole system of representation and values is destined to perish in that revolt.', 'This slavery of the same, the slavery of resemblance, will one day be smashed by the violent resurgence of otherness.', 'We dreamed of passing through the looking-glass, but it is the mirror peoples themselves who will burst in upon our world.', "And `this time will not be defeated'.", 'What will come of this victory?', 'No one knows.', 'A new existence of two equally sovereign peoples, perfectly alien to one another, but in perfect collusion?', 'Something other, at least, than this subjection and this negative fatality.', 'So, everywhere, objects, children, the dead, images, women, everything which serves to provide a passive reflection in a world based on identity, is ready to go on to the counter-offensive.', 'Already they resemble us less and less...', "I'll not be your mirror!", 'To sum up, we find ourselves faced with a dual project: a bid to complete the world, to achieve an integral reality -- and a bid to continue the Nothing (of which the book is a part).', 'Both are doomed to fail.', 'But, whereas the failure of an attempt at completion is, necessarily, negative, the failure of an attempt at annihilation is, necessarily, vital and positive.', 'It is for this reason that thought, which knows it will fail in any case, is duty-bound to set itself criminal objectives.', 'An undertaking directed towards positive objectives cannot allow itself to fail.', 'One which pursues criminal objectives is duty-bound to fail.', 'Such is the well-tempered application of the principle of evil.', 'If the system fails to be everything, nothing will remain of it.', 'If thought fails to be nothing, something will remain of it.\n']
